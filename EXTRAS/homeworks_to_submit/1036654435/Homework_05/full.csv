negative,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
negative,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
positive,@united I wanna be grand staff
negative,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
negative,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
negative,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.

negative,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
negative,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
negative,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
negative,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
neutral,"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
negative,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.

negative,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
negative,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic

negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
negative,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
negative,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"

negative,@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
negative,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
negative,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
negative,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated

negative,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
negative,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
negative,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
negative,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
negative,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!

negative,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
negative,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
negative,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
negative,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
negative,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
negative,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"

negative,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
negative,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
negative,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
negative,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.

negative,"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
negative,@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
negative,@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
negative,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
negative,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
negative,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
negative,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
negative,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."

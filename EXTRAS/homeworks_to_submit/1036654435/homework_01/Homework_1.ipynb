      "You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\n",
      "Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made\n",
      "by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things\n",
      "which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I\n",
      "never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\n",
      "Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\n",
      "is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\n",
      "is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when\n",
      "it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\n",
      "at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\n",
      "it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\n",
      "sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing\n",
      "commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\n",
      "to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\n",
      "you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\n",
      "over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\n",
      "them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a\n",
      "barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\n",
      "juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\n",
      "then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\n",
      "dead people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she\n",
      "wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\n",
      "try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she was\n",
      "a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\n",
      "being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\n",
      "thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that\n",
      "was all right, because she done it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\n",
      "the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,\n",
      "“Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don't scrunch up\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would\n",
      "say, “Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\n",
      "behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\n",
      "I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted\n",
      "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\n",
      "She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\n",
      "the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\n",
      "Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\n",
      "made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it\n",
      "would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\n",
      "place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\n",
      "day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think\n",
      "much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\n",
      "would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad\n",
      "about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n",
      "By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\n",
      "everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\n",
      "and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt\n",
      "so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\n",
      "to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\n",
      "it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\n",
      "that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\n",
      "something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\n",
      "can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\n",
      "grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\n",
      "company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\n",
      "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\n",
      "was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\n",
      "an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\n",
      "and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\n",
      "tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\n",
      "up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But\n",
      "I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\n",
      "you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\n",
      "heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\n",
      "a spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\n",
      "for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\n",
      "know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\n",
      "go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\n",
      "ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\n",
      "trees--something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I\n",
      "could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. That was good!\n",
      "Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the\n",
      "light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped\n",
      "down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\n",
      "there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\n",
      "the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\n",
      "heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\n",
      "a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big nigger,\n",
      "named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\n",
      "clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched\n",
      "his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who dah?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\n",
      "between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\n",
      "together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "right between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\n",
      "Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with\n",
      "the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\n",
      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\n",
      "you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\n",
      "Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down here and\n",
      "listen tell I hears it agin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\n",
      "one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into\n",
      "my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside.\n",
      "Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set\n",
      "still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\n",
      "it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different\n",
      "places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\n",
      "but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun\n",
      "to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\n",
      "comfortable again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\n",
      "went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom\n",
      "whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said\n",
      "no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\n",
      "warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\n",
      "in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I said Jim\n",
      "might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\n",
      "and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\n",
      "Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\n",
      "Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\n",
      "something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\n",
      "so still and lonesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\n",
      "and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\n",
      "the house. Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\n",
      "on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\n",
      "Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\n",
      "and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told\n",
      "it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\n",
      "rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\n",
      "was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\n",
      "got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come\n",
      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\n",
      "nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\n",
      "open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is\n",
      "always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\n",
      "whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\n",
      "Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know 'bout witches?” and\n",
      "that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept\n",
      "that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\n",
      "charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\n",
      "cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\n",
      "saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\n",
      "Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\n",
      "had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\n",
      "it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for\n",
      "a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\n",
      "and been rode by witches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\n",
      "into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\n",
      "awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\n",
      "So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. We\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\n",
      "in blood.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\n",
      "wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the\n",
      "band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\n",
      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\n",
      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\n",
      "killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\n",
      "ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\n",
      "blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\n",
      "and be forgot forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\n",
      "it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\n",
      "the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\n",
      "it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, hain't he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen\n",
      "in these parts for a year or more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of\n",
      "anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready\n",
      "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\n",
      "Watson--they could kill her. Everybody said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\n",
      "and I made my mark on the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what's the line of business of this Gang?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,”\n",
      " says Tom Sawyer.  “We ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of style. We\n",
      "are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\n",
      "on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Must we always kill the people?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different, but\n",
      "mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to\n",
      "the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ransomed? What's that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't know. But that's what they do. I've seen it in books; and so\n",
      "of course that's what we've got to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it. Don't I tell you it's in the\n",

      "and get things all muddled up?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, that's all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation\n",
      "are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it\n",

      "is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,\n",
      "it means that we keep them till they're dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, that's something _like_. That'll answer. Why couldn't you said\n",
      "that before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a\n",
      "bothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying\n",
      "to get loose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a guard\n",
      "over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”\n",

      "like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't\n",

      "quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver\n",
      "a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show,\n",

      "every time. (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got\n",
      "from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball\n",
      "would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference. Jim smelt\n",
      "it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball\n",
      "would think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato\n",
      "and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next\n",
      "morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more,\n",

      "old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin\n",
      "behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and\n",
      "putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket,\n",
      "and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough\n",

      "towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of\n",

      "the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge\n",

      "considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more\n",

      "crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say\n",
      "one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes. He started\n",

      "and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and\n",
      "saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid\n",
      "still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound.\n",
      "I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it\n",
      "seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he\n",

      "\n",
      "Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him\n",
      "alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the\n",
      "old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could\n",

      "\n",
      "By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he\n",

      "dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my\n",

      "'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river\n",
      "about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about\n",

      "rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.\n",
      "We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner.\n",
      "Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch\n",
      "more stuff; but that warn't pap's style. Nine logs was enough for one\n",

      "took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.\n",
      "I judged he wouldn't come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he\n",
      "had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that\n",

      "hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\n",
      "shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\n",
      "with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee and\n",
      "sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\n",
      "bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\n",
      "blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and\n",
      "matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned\n",
      "out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\n",
      "at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched\n",
      "out the gun, and now I was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\n",
      "out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\n",
      "by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\n",
      "sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\n",
      "rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\n",
      "at that place and didn't quite touch ground. If you stood four or five\n",
      "foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice\n",
      "it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely\n",
      "anybody would go fooling around there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track. I\n",
      "followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the\n",
      "river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\n",
      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\n",
      "farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it\n",
      "considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\n",
      "to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\n",
      "on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\n",
      "and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\n",
      "in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\n",
      "the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\n",
      "down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been\n",
      "dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\n",
      "would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\n",
      "touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\n",
      "that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I\n",
      "took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\n",
      "the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\n",
      "I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\n",
      "bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\n",
      "place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then\n",
      "I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\n",
      "the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\n",
      "and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There\n",
      "was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\n",
      "miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. The meal\n",
      "sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped\n",
      "pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\n",
      "accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\n",
      "wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\n",
      "willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I\n",
      "made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself,\n",
      "they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\n",
      "drag the river for me. And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\n",
      "and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\n",
      "that killed me and took the things. They won't ever hunt the river for\n",
      "anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\n",
      "bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\n",
      "Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\n",
      "and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights,\n",
      "and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When\n",
      "I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked\n",
      "around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and\n",
      "miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\n",
      "that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\n",
      "shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\n",
      "You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\n",
      "when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I\n",
      "made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\n",
      "oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. I peeped out through\n",
      "the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\n",
      "I couldn't tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was\n",
      "abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it. Think's I, maybe\n",
      "it's pap, though I warn't expecting him. He dropped below me with the\n",
      "current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\n",
      "and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\n",
      "Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\n",
      "oars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\n",
      "soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half,\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\n",
      "people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and\n",
      "then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\n",
      "\n",
      "I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\n",
      "And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people\n",
      "talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\n",
      "of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\n",
      "nights now. T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\n",
      "reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\n",
      "let him alone. The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\n",
      "old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\n",
      "about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away,\n",
      "and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\n",
      "and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson's\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\n",
      "a steamboat without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar at\n",
      "the head--it was all under water now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into\n",
      "a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\n",
      "from the outside.\n",

      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\n",
      "three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A\n",
      "monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\n",
      "with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down,\n",
      "and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern\n",

      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\n",
      "breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\n",
      "very friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\n",
      "breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\n",
      "sound of “boom!” away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\n",
      "on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry. And there was the\n",
      "ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the\n",
      "matter now.  “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\n",
      "side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\n",
      "carcass come to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\n",
      "because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there,\n",
      "and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\n",
      "enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\n",
      "eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\n",
      "loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\n",
      "drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\n",
      "if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show. I\n",
      "changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\n",
      "have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I\n",
      "most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\n",
      "further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\n",
      "shore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one,\n",
      "and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\n",
      "of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was “baker's bread”--what the\n",
      "quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\n",
      "the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And\n",
      "then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\n",
      "or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\n",
      "and done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\n",
      "thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\n",
      "parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\n",
      "only just the right kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\n",
      "to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\n",
      "close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along down\n",
      "towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\n",
      "and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where\n",
      "the log forked I could peep through.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\n",
      "a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.\n",
      "Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\n",
      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\n",
      "Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge. I\n",
      "hope so, anyway.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\n",
      "in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see\n",
      "them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\n",
      "it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\n",
      "I judged I was gone. If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\n",
      "a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\n",
      "goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\n",
      "of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and\n",
      "further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\n",
      "The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and\n",
      "was giving it up. But they didn't yet a while. They turned around\n",
      "the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\n",
      "under steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over\n",
      "to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\n",
      "island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\n",
      "went home to the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\n",
      "woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\n",
      "under so the rain couldn't get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled\n",
      "him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\n",
      "supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\n",
      "satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\n",
      "on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\n",
      "stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\n",
      "there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\n",
      "can't stay so, you soon get over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so for three days and nights. No difference--just the same thing.\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was\n",
      "boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They\n",
      "would all come handy by and by, I judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\n",
      "far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\n",
      "and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\n",
      "it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\n",
      "fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\n",
      "thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\n",
      "nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\n",
      "and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\n",
      "on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\n",
      "breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\n",
      "old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\n",
      "I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\n",
      "thousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good\n",
      "and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\n",
      "Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. I got\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn't got far when I\n",
      "hear a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\n",
      "beat out. Let's look around.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn't\n",
      "do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\n",
      "find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\n",
      "I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\n",
      "asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A\n",
      "little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\n",
      "the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung\n",
      "her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\n",
      "of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\n",
      "leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\n",
      "the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\n",
      "and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards\n",
      "where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\n",
      "to listen. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the\n",
      "place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\n",
      "through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was\n",
      "close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It\n",
      "most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\n",
      "head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in\n",
      "about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting\n",
      "gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\n",
      "off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see\n",
      "him. I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees,\n",
      "and puts his hands together and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doan' hurt me--don't! I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'. I alwuz\n",
      "liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em. You go en git in de\n",
      "river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz\n",
      "awluz yo' fren'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. I was ever so\n",
      "glad to see Jim. I warn't lonesome now. I told him I warn't afraid of\n",
      "_him_ telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set\n",
      "there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\n",
      "truck? But you got a gun, hain't you? Den we kin git sumfn better den\n",
      "strawbries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strawberries and such truck,” I says.  “Is that what you live on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn' git nuffn else,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come heah de night arter you's killed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, all that time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--indeedy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sah--nuffn else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reck'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de\n",
      "islan'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since the night I got killed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! W'y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got\n",
      "a gun. Dat's good. Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\n",
      "a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\n",
      "coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\n",
      "nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\n",
      "with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him\n",
      "with his knife, and fried him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\n",
      "Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then\n",
      "when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By and by\n",
      "Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it\n",
      "warn't you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom\n",
      "Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then he\n",
      "says:\n",

      "wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\n",
      "high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\n",
      "the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\n",
      "and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\n",
      "side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\n",
      "bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in\n",
      "there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\n",
      "didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\n",
      "in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\n",
      "and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them\n",
      "little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\n",
      "get wet?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\n",
      "side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\n",
      "good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\n",
      "We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty\n",

      "right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\n",
      "too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular\n",
      "summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\n",
      "outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that\n",
      "the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\n",
      "come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\n",
      "pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\n",
      "follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\n",
      "was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and\n",
      "blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little\n",
      "glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,\n",
      "hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\n",
      "in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\n",
      "and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\n",

      "it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\n",

      "wall of high bluffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\n",
      "and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We\n",
      "went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung\n",
      "so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old\n",
      "broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\n",
      "when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\n",
      "account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\n",
      "hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would\n",
      "slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\n",
      "We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.\n",
      "It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and\n",
      "the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor. We\n",
      "could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\n",
      "we didn't show ourselves in daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\n",
      "daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was\n",
      "a two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got\n",
      "aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet,\n",
      "so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then\n",
      "we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and\n",
      "two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\n",
      "was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the\n",
      "floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\n",

      "“De man ain't asleep--he's dead. You hold still--I'll go en see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He went, and bent down and looked, and says:\n",

      "at his face--it's too gashly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\n",
      "he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old\n",
      "greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,\n",
      "and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\n",
      "was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\n",
      "There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\n",
      "women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,\n",
      "too. We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good. There was a\n",
      "boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there\n",
      "was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\n",
      "baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was\n",

      "hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\n",
      "a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\n",
      "candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\n",
      "old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\n",
      "beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\n",
      "and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some\n",
      "monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,\n",
      "and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label\n",
      "on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,\n",
      "and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps\n",
      "was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\n",
      "it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find\n",
      "the other one, though we hunted all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to\n",
      "shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty\n",
      "broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the\n",
      "quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good\n",
      "ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most\n",

      "Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\n",
      "again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\n",
      "hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\n",
      "as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us\n",
      "into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\n",
      "till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\n",
      "ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,\n",
      "and there was a spool in it. Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to\n",
      "coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever\n",
      "catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn't ever seen\n",

      "must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,\n",
      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\n",
      "That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim\n",
      "hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the\n",
      "sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\n",
      "and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said\n",
      "nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around\n",
      "all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\n",
      "well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said\n",

      "little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered\n",
      "who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the\n",

      "say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. But\n",
      "now she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?”\n",
      "\n",

      "they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the\n",
      "place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right\n",
      "about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner\n",
      "every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at\n",
      "them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She showed\n",
      "me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot\n",
      "with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't\n",
      "know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance,\n",
      "and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\n",
      "“Ouch!” it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one.\n",
      "I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course\n",
      "I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his\n",
      "nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a\n",
      "tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\n",
      "would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\n",
      "it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\n",
      "her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\n",
      "went on talking about her and her husband's matters. But she broke off\n",
      "to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap,\n",
      "handy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped\n",
      "my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a\n",
      "minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\n",
      "and very pleasant, and says:\n",

      "“No, you won't. Set down and stay where you are. I ain't going to hurt\n",
      "you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your\n",
      "secret, and trust me. I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll help\n",
      "you. So'll my old man if you want him to. You see, you're a runaway\n",
      "'prentice, that's all. It ain't anything. There ain't no harm in it.\n",

      "go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead,\n",
      "and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty\n",
      "mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it\n",
      "no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\n",
      "chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and\n",
      "I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights,\n",
      "and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\n",
      "home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my\n",
      "uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck\n",
      "out for this town of Goshen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's\n",
      "ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn\n",
      "into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I\n",
      "must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. I got\n",
      "to be moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.”\n",

      "\n",

      "poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a\n",
      "man always does t'other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything,\n",
      "hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as\n",
      "awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw\n",

      "turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out\n",

      "you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can\n",
      "to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and next time\n",

      "I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks\n",
      "and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I\n",
      "jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to\n",

      "It must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at\n",
      "last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come\n",
      "along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\n",
      "shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\n",
      "put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We\n",
      "was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn't\n",
      "good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\n",
      "built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed\n",
      "away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no\n",
      "fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\n",
      "big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\n",
      "the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\n",
      "had been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has\n",
      "cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\n",
      "side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\n",
      "warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day,\n",
      "and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\n",
      "up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all\n",
      "about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\n",
      "a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\n",
      "down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. Well, then, I\n",
      "said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he\n",
      "bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\n",
      "believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\n",
      "time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\n",
      "below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\n",
      "So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long\n",
      "as they didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\n",
      "so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\n",
      "wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\n",
      "dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\n",
      "the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\n",
      "reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\n",
      "layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\n",
      "to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\n",
      "or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra\n",
      "steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\n",
      "or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\n",
      "on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\n",
      "coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\n",
      "to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\n",
      "a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\n",
      "still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the\n",
      "channel, but hunted easy water.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\n",
      "that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,\n",
      "and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of\n",
      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\n",
      "up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\n",
      "warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle. We\n",
      "had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\n",
      "us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The\n",
      "fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\n",
      "In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\n",
      "people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\n",
      "spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There warn't a sound\n",
      "there; everybody was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\n",
      "village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\n",
      "stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\n",
      "comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when\n",
      "you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\n",
      "find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. I never see\n",
      "pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\n",
      "say, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\n",
      "that kind. Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you\n",
      "was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\n",
      "anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\n",
      "Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\n",
      "right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\n",
      "from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned\n",
      "it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all\n",
      "one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\n",
      "whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\n",
      "or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\n",
      "concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We warn't feeling just\n",
      "right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way\n",
      "it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\n",
      "wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we\n",
      "lived pretty high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\n",
      "a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\n",
      "sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\n",
      "When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\n",
      "and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,\n",
      "looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\n",
      "We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very\n",
      "distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\n",
      "water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\n",
      "chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\n",
      "when the flashes come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\n",
      "I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\n",
      "laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I\n",
      "wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\n",
      "there was there. So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Le's land on her, Jim.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame' well,\n",
      "en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not\n",
      "dey's a watchman on dat wrack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain't nothing to watch but\n",
      "the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk\n",
      "his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\n",
      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?” Jim\n",
      "couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  “And besides,” I says,\n",
      "“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.\n",
      "Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat\n",
      "captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't\n",
      "care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a\n",
      "candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\n",
      "Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he\n",
      "wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd\n",
      "land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't he throw style\n",
      "into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you'd think it\n",
      "was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer\n",
      "_was_ here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any more\n",
      "than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us\n",
      "the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\n",
      "made fast there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to\n",
      "labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\n",
      "feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\n",
      "dark we couldn't see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward\n",
      "end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\n",
      "front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\n",
      "through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\n",
      "seem to hear low voices in yonder!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\n",
      "along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\n",
      "then I heard a voice wail out and say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another voice said, pretty loud:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this way before. You always want\n",
      "more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because\n",
      "you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time you've said\n",
      "it jest one time too many. You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in\n",
      "this country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with\n",
      "curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,\n",
      "and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So I\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\n",
      "in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\n",
      "cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the\n",
      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\n",
      "This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd _like_ to! And I orter, too--a mean skunk!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don't, Bill;\n",
      "I hain't ever goin' to tell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and\n",
      "say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Deed you _ain't!_ You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet\n",
      "you.” And once he said:  “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the\n",
      "best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both. And what _for_? Jist\n",
      "for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for. But\n",
      "I lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put\n",
      "_up_ that pistol, Bill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't want to, Jake Packard. I'm for killin' him--and didn't he kill\n",
      "old Hatfield jist the same way--and don't he deserve it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you\n",
      "long's I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\n",
      "and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\n",
      "to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\n",
      "slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting\n",
      "run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.\n",
      "The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my\n",
      "stateroom, he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here--come in here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up\n",
      "in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there,\n",
      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\n",
      "I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\n",
      "anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I\n",
      "didn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body _couldn't_\n",
      "breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted\n",
      "to kill Turner. He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares\n",
      "to him _now_ it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way\n",
      "we've served him. Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; now\n",
      "you hear _me_. I'm for putting him out of his troubles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So'm I,” says Packard, very quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's all\n",
      "right. Le's go and do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. You listen to me.\n",
      "Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's _got_ to be\n",
      "done. But what I say is this: it ain't good sense to go court'n around\n",
      "after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's\n",
      "jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks. Ain't\n",
      "that so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You bet it is. But how you goin' to manage it this time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever\n",
      "pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide\n",
      "the truck. Then we'll wait. Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two\n",
      "hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See?\n",
      "He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own\n",
      "self. I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.\n",
      "I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it\n",
      "ain't good sense, it ain't good morals. Ain't I right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I reck'n you are. But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, then; come along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled\n",
      "forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse\n",
      "whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a\n",
      "moan, and I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a\n",
      "gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set\n",
      "her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the\n",
      "wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their\n",
      "boat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em.\n",
      "Quick--hurry! I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You\n",
      "start at the raft, and--”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with\n",
      "such a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd\n",
      "_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went\n",
      "a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\n",
      "too--seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim\n",
      "said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't\n",
      "hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left\n",
      "on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck\n",
      "for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\n",
      "forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the\n",
      "edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the\n",
      "cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely\n",
      "see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been\n",
      "aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his\n",
      "head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;\n",
      "but he jerked it in again, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and\n",
      "set down. It was Packard. Then Bill _he_ come out and got in. Packard\n",

      "four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty\n",
      "men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open\n",

      "We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got\n",

      "talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to\n",

      "was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,\n",
      "and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and\n",

      "\n",
      "We talked it all over. It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't\n",
      "take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn't no way but to wait\n",
      "for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept\n",

      "\n",
      "By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no\n",

      "anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after\n",

      "\n",
      "The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we\n",
      "didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and\n",
      "more. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next\n",
      "meanest thing to fog. You can't tell the shape of the river, and you\n",
      "can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\n",
      "comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she\n",
      "would see it. Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they\n",
      "go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but\n",
      "nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she\n",
      "was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see\n",
      "how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\n",
      "a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\n",
      "he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\n",
      "try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She\n",
      "was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\n",
      "cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged\n",
      "out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\n",
      "like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\n",
      "over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\n",
      "engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went\n",
      "overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight\n",
      "through the raft.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel\n",
      "had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could\n",
      "always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\n",
      "minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\n",
      "nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\n",
      "stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\n",
      "churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I\n",
      "could hear her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;\n",
      "so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” and\n",
      "struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see\n",
      "that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\n",
      "meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\n",
      "long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\n",
      "bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\n",
      "rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\n",
      "big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to\n",
      "rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling\n",
      "and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.\n",

      "coming.”\n",
      "\n",

      "on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann\n",
      "run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went\n",

      "I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and\n",
      "started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how\n",
      "I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I\n",

      "\n",

      "slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it\n",

      "with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in\n",
      "town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\n",
      "of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that\n",
      "was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\n",
      "pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\n",
      "they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\n",
      "same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\n",
      "up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\n",
      "a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\n",
      "a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\n",
      "pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;\n",
      "and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\n",
      "up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\n",

      "Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\n",
      "made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the\n",
      "parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;\n",
      "and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open\n",
      "their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through\n",
      "underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\n",
      "behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\n",
      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\n",
      "grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\n",
      "than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\n",

      "was, underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\n",
      "blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It\n",
      "come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books,\n",
      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why. I read considerable in it\n",
      "now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\n",
      "read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\n",
      "Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\n",
      "was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. And\n",
      "there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\n",
      "down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\n",
      "and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the\n",
      "Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the\n",
      "daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\n",
      "fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see\n",
      "before--blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black\n",
      "dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\n",
      "the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\n",
      "a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\n",
      "very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\n",
      "tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\n",
      "hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\n",
      "and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”\n",
      " Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\n",
      "to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\n",
      "chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\n",
      "laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”\n",
      " There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\n",
      "moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\n",
      "one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\n",
      "mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” These\n",
      "was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\n",
      "to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\n",
      "fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\n",
      "more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\n",
      "what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\n",
      "having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they\n",
      "said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\n",
      "every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\n",
      "done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman\n",
      "in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\n",
      "off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\n",
      "the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\n",
      "breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\n",
      "towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\n",
      "and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\n",
      "before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\n",
      "head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\n",
      "flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young\n",
      "woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\n",
      "many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\n",
      "obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\n",
      "Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\n",
      "It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name\n",

      "If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was\n",

      "said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't ever have to\n",
      "stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't\n",
      "find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down\n",
      "another one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write about\n",

      "then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was\n",
      "Whistler. She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,\n",
      "but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many's the\n",
      "time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get\n",
      "out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been\n",
      "aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that\n",
      "family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between\n",
      "us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was\n",
      "alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some\n",
      "about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\n",
      "myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline's\n",
      "room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she\n",
      "liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.\n",
      "The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty\n",

      "so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken”\n",
      " and play “The Battle of Prague” on it. The walls of all the rooms was\n",

      "Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all\n",
      "over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\n",
      "said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\n",
      "in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more\n",
      "quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and\n",
      "very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\n",
      "anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\n",
      "he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\n",
      "a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\n",
      "deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\n",
      "you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\n",
      "straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\n",
      "every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\n",
      "to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\n",
      "and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He\n",
      "carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn't no\n",
      "frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud. He was\n",
      "as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\n",
      "confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\n",
      "straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\n",
      "flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\n",
      "and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn't ever have to\n",
      "tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\n",
      "where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\n",
      "most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned\n",
      "into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\n",
      "enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.\n",
      "\n",

      "the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and\n",
      "he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and\n",
      "then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and _they_\n",
      "bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,\n",
      "all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and\n",

      "I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in\n",

      "Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,\n",
      "they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put\n",
      "in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\n",
      "and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\n",
      "night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\n",
      "in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\n",
      "willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next\n",
      "we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\n",
      "off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\n",
      "deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres--perfectly\n",
      "still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\n",
      "a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the\n",
      "water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you\n",
      "couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\n",
      "paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\n",
      "warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\n",
      "drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\n",
      "long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\n",
      "jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\n",
      "streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\n",
      "and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\n",
      "of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\n",
      "log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\n",
      "the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\n",
      "throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\n",
      "comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\n",
      "on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\n",
      "because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\n",
      "do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\n",
      "smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\n",
      "\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch\n",
      "the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\n",
      "lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\n",
      "maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\n",
      "other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\n",
      "a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\n",
      "nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness. Next\n",
      "you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\n",
      "chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\n",
      "axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\n",
      "up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\n",
      "_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water. So we\n",
      "would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once\n",
      "there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\n",
      "tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them. A scow or a\n",
      "raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\n",
      "laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made\n",

      "\n",
      "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\n",
      "middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\n",
      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\n",
      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made\n",
      "for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on\n",
      "clothes, nohow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\n",
      "time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\n",
      "a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\n",
      "you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\n",
      "you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\n",
      "It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled\n",
      "with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\n",
      "discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he\n",
      "allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would\n",
      "have took too long to _make_ so many. Jim said the moon could a _laid_\n",
      "them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing\n",
      "against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\n",
      "could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\n",
      "streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the\n",
      "nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\n",
      "dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\n",
      "of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\n",
      "pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\n",
      "her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\n",
      "waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\n",
      "raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't\n",
      "tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\n",
      "three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\n",

      "the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile\n",
      "up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some\n",
      "berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed\n",
      "the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as\n",
      "they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was\n",
      "after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim. I was about to dig out\n",
      "from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung\n",
      "out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing\n",
      "nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs\n",
      "a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't you do it. I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time\n",

      "off the scent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,\n",
      "and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,\n",
      "shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't\n",
      "see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\n",
      "further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at\n",
      "all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the\n",

      "in the cottonwoods and was safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\n",

      "into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one. He had\n",

      "he said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we\n",
      "was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most\n",
      "anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we\n",
      "ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,”\n",
      " or “Your Lordship”--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain\n",
      "“Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and\n",

      "below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,\n",

      "by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every\n",
      "second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\n",
      "a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\n",
      "and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!\n",
      "bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling\n",
      "and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and\n",
      "another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\n",
      "but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind. We didn't have no trouble\n",

      "cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. The king was\n",
      "satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\n",
      "most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\n",
      "time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\n",
      "king and told him to get his part by heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\n",
      "after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run\n",
      "in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would\n",

      "When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and\n",

      "too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the\n",

      "camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it;\n",
      "a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and\n",

      "littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of\n",
      "horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke shed\n",

      "\n",
      "We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most\n",
      "awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from\n",
      "twenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\n",
      "everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep\n",
      "off the flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\n",
      "branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of\n",
      "watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\n",
      "bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside\n",
      "slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\n",
      "for legs. They didn't have no backs. The preachers had high platforms\n",
      "to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets;\n",
      "and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\n",
      "young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and\n",
      "some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\n",
      "shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks\n",
      "was courting on the sly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined\n",
      "out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\n",
      "there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\n",
      "he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on. The people woke up\n",
      "more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\n",
      "begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to\n",
      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\n",
      "the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\n",
      "of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\n",
      "words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\n",
      "his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\n",
      "that, shouting, “It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon\n",
      "it and live!” And people would shout out, “Glory!--A-a-_men_!” And so\n",
      "he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn and\n",
      "soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite\n",
      "heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse\n",
      "is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!”\n",
      " (_A-A-Men_! _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)\n",
      "\n",
      "And so on. You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on\n",
      "account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the\n",
      "crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'\n",
      "bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\n",
      "mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and\n",
      "shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\n",
      "over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and\n",
      "the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He\n",
      "told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\n",
      "Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\n",
      "a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\n",
      "goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\n",
      "without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that\n",
      "ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for\n",
      "the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start\n",
      "right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest\n",
      "of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could\n",
      "do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews\n",
      "in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there\n",
      "without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced\n",
      "a pirate he would say to him, “Don't you thank me, don't you give me no\n",
      "credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,\n",
      "natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher\n",
      "there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody\n",
      "sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!” Well,\n",
      "a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let _him_\n",
      "pass the hat around!” Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,\n",
      "and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being\n",
      "so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the\n",
      "prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would\n",
      "up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he\n",
      "always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or\n",
      "six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to\n",
      "live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said\n",
      "as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and\n",
      "besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to\n",
      "work on the pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\n",
      "collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had\n",
      "fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\n",
      "wagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said,\n",
      "take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the\n",
      "missionarying line. He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't\n",
      "amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come\n",
      "to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. He had set\n",
      "up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\n",
      "printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars. And he\n",
      "had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he\n",

      "clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards\n",

      "another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt\n",

      "he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter away from\n",

      "dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight;\n",
      "I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up\n",

      "graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their\n",
      "heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and\n",

      "the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the\n",
      "other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I\n",

      "as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever\n",

      "And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to\n",
      "ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued\n",
      "and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show\n",
      "come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make\n",
      "fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that\n",
      "stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\n",
      "benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him\n",
      "out!” and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster\n",
      "he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no\n",
      "disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more\n",
      "trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.\n",
      "So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute\n",
      "he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,\n",
      "with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\n",
      "drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\n",
      "jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\n",
      "till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men\n",
      "could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,\n",
      "round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging\n",
      "to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\n",
      "and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. It\n",
      "warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\n",
      "But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,\n",
      "a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\n",
      "dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\n",
      "too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\n",
      "as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his\n",
      "clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\n",
      "the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\n",
      "was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\n",
      "ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\n",
      "hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\n",
      "the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the\n",
      "sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own\n",
      "men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on\n",
      "to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't\n",

      "Next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in\n",
      "the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the\n",
      "duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim\n",
      "he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few\n",
      "hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to\n",
      "lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him\n",
      "all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all\n",
      "by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway\n",
      "nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\n",
      "roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed\n",
      "Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\n",
      "white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\n",
      "and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\n",
      "dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days. Blamed if\n",
      "he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took\n",
      "and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\n",
      "foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight\n",
      "better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\n",
      "over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself\n",
      "free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\n",
      "out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\n",
      "a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\n",
      "Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\n",
      "wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he was\n",
      "dead, he looked considerable more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\n",
      "so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe\n",
      "the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn't hit no\n",
      "project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd\n",
      "lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up\n",
      "something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\n",
      "over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\n",
      "to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all\n",
      "bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n\n",
      "on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king's\n",
      "duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never\n",
      "knowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked\n",
      "like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off\n",
      "his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\n",
      "and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,\n",
      "and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I\n",
      "got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\n",
      "up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple\n",
      "of hours, taking on freight. Says the king:\n",
      "\n",

      "a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the\n",
      "sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a\n",
      "couple of big carpet-bags by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Run her nose in shore,” says the king. I done it.  “Wher' you bound\n",

      "I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was\n",
      "mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.\n",

      "down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he\n",

      "chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin\n",

      "leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his\n",

      "before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,\n",
      "and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody\n",
      "saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was\n",

      "his funeral orgies sh'd be public.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and\n",
      "every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke\n",
      "he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,\n",
      "“_Obsequies_, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and\n",
      "reaching it over people's heads to him. The king he reads it and puts\n",
      "it in his pocket, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart's_ aluz right. Asks me\n",

      "welcome. But he needn't a worried--it was jest what I was at.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his\n",
      "funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And\n",
      "when he done it the third time he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it\n",
      "ain't--obsequies bein' the common term--but because orgies is the right\n",
      "term. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now--it's gone out. We\n",
      "say orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing\n",
      "you're after more exact. It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek\n",
      "_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover\n",
      "up; hence in_ter._ So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public\n",
      "funeral.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the _worst_ I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed\n",
      "right in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says, “Why,\n",

      "\n",
      "“All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him; “we'll try and\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off\n",
      "for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for\n",
      "Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was\n",
      "a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and\n",
      "sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.\n",
      "The king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was\n",
      "plain but nice. She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps\n",
      "took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said\n",
      "they warn't. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was\n",
      "a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was an\n",
      "old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts\n",
      "of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room\n",
      "with. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for\n",
      "these fixings, and so don't disturb them. The duke's room was pretty\n",
      "small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,\n",
      "and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them,\n",
      "and the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of\n",
      "the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits\n",
      "was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried\n",
      "chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to\n",
      "force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,\n",
      "and said so--said “How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?” and\n",
      "“Where, for the land's sake, _did_ you get these amaz'n pickles?” and\n",
      "all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a\n",
      "supper, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen\n",
      "off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up\n",
      "the things. The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest\n",

      "\n",
      "“Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.” I\n",
      "knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he\n",
      "goes to our church, she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What--regular?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--regular. His pew's right over opposite ourn--on t'other side the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels. There\n",
      "in the palace at Sheffield they've got furnaces, and he wants his water\n",

      "different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he\n",
      "wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the\n",
      "law. But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she\n",

      "\n",
      "“Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“That's always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before\n",
      "they're hurt. I hain't done nothing to him. He's told some stretchers,\n",
      "I reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bit\n",

      "\n",
      "“I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, Mam, he said--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It don't make no difference what he _said_--that ain't the thing. The\n",
      "thing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make\n",
      "him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I'm letting that old reptile rob\n",
      "her of her money!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give\n",
      "Hare-lip hark from the tomb!\n",
      "\n",
      "Says I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her\n",
      "of her money!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely\n",
      "again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly\n",
      "anything left o' poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask his pardon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful\n",
      "it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so\n",
      "she could do it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her of\n",
      "her money. And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves\n",
      "out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so\n",
      "ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up;\n",
      "I'll hive that money for them or bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When\n",
      "I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself,\n",
      "shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No--that\n",
      "won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\n",
      "make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No--I\n",
      "dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the\n",
      "money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it. If she was to\n",
      "fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,\n",
      "I judge. No; there ain't no good way but one. I got to steal that\n",
      "money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion\n",
      "that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going\n",
      "to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're\n",
      "worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and\n",
      "by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell\n",
      "Mary Jane where it's hid. But I better hive it tonight if I can,\n",
      "because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he\n",
      "might scare them out of here yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was\n",
      "dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with\n",
      "my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let\n",
      "anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to\n",
      "his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do nothing\n",
      "without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd\n",
      "got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time\n",
      "I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I\n",
      "reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched\n",
      "the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and\n",
      "snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\n",
      "\n",
      "They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to\n",
      "get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed\n",
      "when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under\n",
      "the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then, and\n",
      "the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what is it? And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for\n",
      "us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a\n",
      "chance to talk us over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, this is it, Capet. I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That\n",
      "doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I've got a\n",
      "notion, and I think it's a sound one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it, duke?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip\n",
      "it down the river with what we've got. Specially, seeing we got it so\n",
      "easy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of\n",
      "course we allowed to have to steal it back. I'm for knocking off and\n",
      "lighting out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a been\n",
      "a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The\n",
      "king rips out and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! And not sell out the rest o' the property? March off like\n",
      "a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o'\n",
      "property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?--and all good,\n",
      "salable stuff, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't\n",

      "they had.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, how you talk!” says the king.  “We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at\n",
      "all but jest this money. The people that _buys_ the property is the\n",
      "suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it--which\n",
      "won't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and it 'll all\n",
      "go back to the estate. These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin,\n",
      "and that's enough for _them_; they're young and spry, and k'n easy\n",
      "earn a livin'. _they_ ain't a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think--there's\n",
      "thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off. Bless you, _they_\n",
      "ain't got noth'n' to complain of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all\n",
      "right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that\n",
      "doctor hanging over them. But the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cuss the doctor! What do we k'yer for _him_? Hain't we got all the\n",
      "fools in town on our side? And ain't that a big enough majority in any\n",
      "town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they got ready to go down stairs again. The duke says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't think we put that money in a good place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That cheered me up. I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of\n",
      "no kind to help me. The king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know\n",
      "the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds\n",
      "up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and\n",
      "not borrow some of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your head's level agin, duke,” says the king; and he comes a-fumbling\n",
      "under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to\n",
      "the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them\n",
      "fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what\n",
      "I'd better do if they did catch me. But the king he got the bag before\n",
      "I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned\n",
      "I was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw\n",
      "tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two\n",
      "amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only\n",

      "twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now.\n",

      "over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “_He\n",

      "down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in\n",
      "his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the\n",
      "world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people\n",
      "gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old\n",
      "gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty\n",
      "soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an\n",
      "Englishman--not the king's way, though the king's _was_ pretty good for\n",
      "an imitation. I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate\n",
      "him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll\n",
      "acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and\n",
      "answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his\n",
      "arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the\n",
      "night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his\n",
      "brother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to\n",
      "amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with. We are\n",
      "who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can\n",
      "prove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel\n",
      "and wait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and\n",
      "blethers out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain't_ it?--and very convenient, too,\n",
      "for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how. Lost\n",
      "their baggage! That's _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the\n",
      "_circumstances_!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,\n",
      "or maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was\n",
      "a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind\n",
      "made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and\n",
      "was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and\n",
      "then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone\n",
      "up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along\n",
      "and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the\n",
      "king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this\n",
      "town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what time o' day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the evenin'--'bout an hour er two before sundown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_How'd_ you come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_'--in a\n",
      "canoe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a lie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an\n",
      "old man and a preacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint\n",
      "that mornin'. I live up there, don't I? Well, I was up there, and\n",
      "he was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim\n",
      "Collins and a boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor he up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I would, but I don't know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know\n",
      "him perfectly easy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was me he pointed at. The doctor says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if\n",
      "_these_ two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all. I think it's our\n",
      "duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into\n",
      "this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We'll take\n",
      "these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I\n",
      "reckon we'll find out _something_ before we get through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so\n",
      "we all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by\n",
      "the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and\n",
      "fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're\n",
      "frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about.\n",
      "If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter\n",
      "Wilks left? It ain't unlikely. If these men ain't frauds, they won't\n",
      "object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove\n",
      "they're all right--ain't that so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty\n",
      "tight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked\n",
      "sorrowful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition\n",
      "to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation\n",
      "o' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send\n",
      "and see, if you want to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is it, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it\n",
      "inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few\n",
      "days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'\n",
      "used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England.\n",
      "The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down\n",
      "stairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got\n",
      "clean away with it. My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn't altogether\n",
      "believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said\n",
      "no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I\n",
      "never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up\n",
      "my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.\n",
      "That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are _you_ English, too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had\n",
      "it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about\n",
      "supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and\n",
      "kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They\n",
      "made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;\n",
      "and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the\n",
      "old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. And by and by\n",
      "they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a left-handed\n",
      "look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\n",
      "right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\n",
      "and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\n",
      "fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you. I reckon\n",
      "you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is\n",
      "practice. You do it pretty awkward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,\n",
      "anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--” The king broke in and\n",
      "reached out his hand, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often\n",
      "about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\n",
      "pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side\n",
      "and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“That 'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your\n",
      "brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\n",
      "his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\n",
      "and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\n",
      "duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer\n",
      "turns to the new old gentleman and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. The lawyer looked\n",
      "powerful astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it beats _me_”--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\n",
      "and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\n",
      "_them_ again; and then says:  “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\n",
      "and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't\n",
      "write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\n",
      "you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here's _this_ old\n",
      "gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't\n",
      "write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at\n",
      "all. Now, here's some letters from--”\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother\n",
      "there--so he copies for me. It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Well_!” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things. I've got some\n",
      "of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we\n",
      "can com--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He _can't_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.  “If he\n",
      "could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\n",
      "and mine too. Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer done it, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\n",
      "resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I\n",
      "thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\n",
      "partly. But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em\n",
      "Wilkses”--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\n",
      "_then_! Indeed he wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test. Said his\n",
      "brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried\n",
      "to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\n",
      "he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and\n",
      "warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\n",
      "saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay\n",
      "out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it. We're both here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\n",
      "squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\n",
      "him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\n",
      "most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\n",
      "notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\n",
      "He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\n",
      "there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says\n",
      "I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.\n",
      "Well, did he? A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't. I reckon\n",
      "he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\n",
      "they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\n",
      "Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mf! It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it! _yes_, sir, I k'n\n",
      "tell you what's tattooed on his breast. It's jest a small, thin, blue\n",
      "arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.\n",
      "_now_ what do you say--hey?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\n",
      "cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\n",
      "his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“There--you've heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter\n",
      "Wilks' breast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them spoke up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We didn't see no such mark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” says the old gentleman.  “Now, what you _did_ see on his breast\n",
      "was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\n",
      "young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P--B--W”--and he marked\n",
      "them that way on a piece of paper.  “Come, ain't that what you saw?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them spoke up again, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, we _didn't_. We never seen any marks at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds! Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!\n",
      "le's ride 'em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there\n",
      "was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,\n",
      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen--gentle_men!_ Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you\n",
      "_please_! There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That took them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\n",
      "and the doctor sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\n",
      "_them_ along, too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don't find them marks we'll\n",
      "lynch the whole gang!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I _was_ scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you\n",
      "know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\n",
      "graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\n",
      "town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the\n",
      "evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;\n",
      "because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and\n",
      "blow on our dead-beats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\n",
      "wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\n",
      "lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst\n",
      "the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever\n",
      "was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from\n",
      "what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time\n",
      "if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to\n",
      "save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the\n",
      "world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they\n",
      "didn't find them--\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think\n",
      "about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful\n",
      "time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\n",
      "wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He\n",
      "dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\n",
      "like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had\n",
      "about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't\n",
      "thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the\n",
      "flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a\n",
      "mile off, to borrow one.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain\n",
      "started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come\n",
      "brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took\n",
      "no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute\n",
      "you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the\n",
      "shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the\n",
      "dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then\n",
      "such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to\n",
      "scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it\n",
      "was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,\n",
      "and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and\n",
      "panting.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,\n",
      "and somebody sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and\n",
      "give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit\n",
      "out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all\n",
      "to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the\n",
      "buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of\n",
      "the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so\n",
      "I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the\n",
      "main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and\n",
      "set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and\n",
      "disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by,\n",
      "_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up\n",
      "sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind\n",
      "me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this\n",

      "them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the\n",
      "first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and\n",

      "into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money\n",

      "to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I\n",
      "knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie--I found\n",
      "that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to\n",
      "do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and\n",
      "then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as\n",
      "light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I\n",
      "got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down\n",
      "and wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\n",

      "straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking\n",
      "how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost\n",
      "and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our\n",
      "trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day\n",
      "and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we\n",
      "a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I\n",
      "couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the\n",
      "other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of\n",
      "calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when\n",
      "I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,\n",
      "up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call\n",
      "me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how\n",
      "good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\n",
      "the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was\n",
      "the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's\n",
      "got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\n",
      "I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\n",
      "says to myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell”--and tore it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let\n",
      "them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the\n",
      "whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\n",
      "which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And\n",
      "for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\n",
      "and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\n",
      "long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\n",
      "suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\n",
      "raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the\n",
      "night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\n",
      "and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\n",
      "another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed\n",
      "below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\n",
      "and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\n",
      "sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\n",
      "of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\n",
      "it, “Phelps's Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind,\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\n",
      "the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along,\n",
      "straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\n",
      "the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\n",
      "performance--like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I\n",
      "was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hel-_lo_! Where'd _you_ come from?” Then he says, kind of glad and\n",
      "eager, “Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was your idea for asking _me_?” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\n",
      "a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered\n",
      "me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\n",
      "a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\n",
      "and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\n",
      "along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\n",
      "him. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\n",
      "country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we\n",
      "fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and\n",
      "see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\n",
      "leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\n",
      "the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\n",
      "no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\n",
      "cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what _did_ become of the\n",
      "raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft. That old fool had\n",
      "made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\n",
      "the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\n",
      "what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\n",
      "found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\n",
      "shook us, and run off down the river.'”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\n",
      "world, and the only property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\n",
      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\n",
      "enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\n",
      "there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\n",
      "shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where's\n",
      "that ten cents? Give it here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\n",
      "money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never\n",
      "said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We'd skin him if he done\n",
      "that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can he blow? Hain't he run off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's\n",
      "gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Sold_ him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, and\n",
      "that was my money. Where is he?--I want my nigger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your\n",
      "blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\n",
      "Blamed if I think I'd trust you. Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\n",
      "before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\n",
      "I got to turn out and find my nigger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\n",
      "his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you'll\n",
      "promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\n",
      "where to find him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I promised, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--” and then he stopped. You see, he\n",
      "started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\n",
      "study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he\n",
      "was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\n",
      "the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\n",
      "lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days. And I'll start this\n",
      "very afternoon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\n",
      "neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in\n",
      "your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\n",
      "_us_, d'ye hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I\n",
      "wanted to be left free to work my plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\n",
      "to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\n",
      "idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down\n",
      "South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\n",
      "maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\n",
      "getting 'em out. Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\n",
      "mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn't look around, but I\n",
      "kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out\n",
      "at that. I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\n",
      "I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'. I\n",
      "reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\n",
      "around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\n",
      "get away. I didn't want no trouble with their kind. I'd seen all I\n",

      "waited till he come along. I says “Hold on!” and it stopped alongside,\n",
      "and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed\n",
      "two or three times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says:\n",

      "plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church\n",
      "and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was\n",
      "worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and\n",
      "done the same way, down South.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt\n",

      "don't come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for\n",
      "interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for\n",
      "the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we\n",
      "was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and an\n",
      "audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances\n",
      "it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was\n",

      "\n",

      "“Oh, I _can't_ make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it. I'll\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh, _do_,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a\n",
      "bit in the world. You must stay. It's a long, dusty three mile, and\n",
      "we can't let you walk. And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on\n",
      "another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us. Come\n",
      "right in and make yourself at home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be\n",
      "persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger\n",
      "from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made\n",
      "another bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and\n",
      "everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and\n",
      "wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,\n",
      "still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the\n",
      "mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was\n",
      "going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of\n",
      "her hand, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You owdacious puppy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kind of hurt, and says:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You're s'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am? I've a good notion to take\n",

      "He looked kind of humble, and says:\n",
      "\n",

      "like it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you born fool!” She took up the spinning stick, and it looked\n",
      "like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.\n",
      " “What made you think I'd like it?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, everybody. They all said so, m'am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her\n",
      "fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:\n",

      "“Who's 'everybody'? Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot\n",
      "short.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. They told me to. They all told\n",
      "me to. They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it. They all said\n",
      "it--every one of them. But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it no more--I\n",
      "won't, honest.”\n",
      "\n",

      "They said you would, and I thought you would. But--” He stopped and\n",
      "looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye\n",
      "somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, “Didn't\n",
      "_you_ think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?”\n",

      "“Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b'lieve I didn't.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“No, not till you've asked me first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed\n",

      "come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a\n",
      "first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me\n",
      "to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. But it\n",
      "was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain't no healthy place for a stranger\n",

      "neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\n",
      "There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\n",

      "people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin\n",
      "pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;\n",

      "all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the\n",
      "world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big\n",

      "\n",
      "So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was\n",

      "this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,\n",
      "before everybody. I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all. It was\n",
      "outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be\n",

      "in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and\n",
      "the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“That's more _like_,” he says.  “It's real mysterious, and troublesome,\n",
      "and good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.\n",
      "There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long\n",
      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. The door to it was at\n",
      "the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\n",
      "searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\n",
      "so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down,\n",
      "and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\n",
      "and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\n",
      "with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\n",
      "some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\n",
      "The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\n",
      "the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says;\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out. It 'll take about a week!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have\n",
      "to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that\n",
      "warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\n",
      "climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three\n",
      "times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\n",
      "busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\n",
      "was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this\n",
      "time he made the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\n",
      "to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it\n",
      "_was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through\n",
      "breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up\n",
      "a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\n",
      "leaving, the key come from the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches\n",
      "off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\n",
      "long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\n",
      "So Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you\n",
      "heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at\n",
      "'im?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I hunched Tom, and whispers:\n",

      "\n",
      "“No, it warn't; but it's the plan _now_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got in\n",
      "we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure\n",
      "enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, _Huck_! En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn't know\n",
      "nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger\n",
      "busted in and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and\n",
      "kind of wondering, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does _who_ know us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”\n",

      "“What _put_ it dar? Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, that's mighty curious. _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?\n",
      "_what_ did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,\n",
      "“Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\n",
      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you sing out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain't said nothing, sah.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a word?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sah, I hain't said a word.”\n",

      "\n",
      "So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and\n",
      "says, kind of severe:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? What made you think\n",
      "somebody sung out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.\n",

      "Please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole\n",
      "me; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ no witches. I jis' wish to goodness he was\n",

      "Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to\n",

      "\n",
      "“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to\n",

      "\n",

      "what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called\n",

      "he warn't a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was\n",
      "that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,\n",
      "when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he\n",
      "made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it\n",
      "was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we\n",
      "_needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't\n",
      "need it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was.\n",
      "He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim\n",

      "that, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled\n",
      "down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he\n",

      "watch. By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile\n",

      "of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these\n",

      "“Yes he will _last_, too. You don't reckon it's going to take\n",

      "take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.\n",
      "He'll hear Jim ain't from there. Then his next move will be to\n",
      "advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can't resk being as long\n",
      "digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be\n",
      "a couple of years; but we can't. Things being so uncertain, what I\n",
      "recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;\n",
      "and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it\n",
      "thirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the\n",

      "“Now, there's _sense_ in that,” I says.  “Letting on don't cost nothing;\n",
      "letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind\n",
      "letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn't strain\n",
      "me none, after I got my hand in. So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a\n",
      "couple of case-knives.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the\n",
      "lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our\n",
      "pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the\n",
      "way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom\n",
      "said he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and\n",
      "when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there\n",
      "was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the\n",
      "ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.\n",
      "So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then\n",
      "we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see\n",
      "we'd done anything hardly. At last I says:\n",

      "Tom Sawyer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped\n",
      "digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.\n",
      "Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. If we was prisoners\n",
      "it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no\n",
      "hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while\n",
      "they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and\n",
      "we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,\n",
      "and the way it ought to be done. But _we_ can't fool along; we got to\n",
      "rush; we ain't got no time to spare. If we was to put in another\n",
      "night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get\n",
      "well--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner.”\n",

      "“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll tell you. It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like\n",
      "it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way: we got to dig him\n",
      "out with the picks, and _let on_ it's case-knives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Now_ you're _talking_!” I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler\n",
      "all the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says.  “Picks is the thing, moral or no\n",

      "When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school\n",
      "book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done. What I\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well,” he says, “there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like\n",
      "this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by\n",
      "and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,\n",
      "and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and\n",
      "knows better. It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,\n",
      "_without_ any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it\n",
      "wouldn't for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and\n",

      "\n",
      "I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought. I scratched around\n",
      "amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took\n",
      "it and went to work, and never said a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was always just that particular. Full of principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\n",
      "and made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as\n",
      "long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for\n",
      "it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing\n",
      "his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his\n",
      "hands was so sore. At last he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't no use, it can't be done. What you reckon I better do? Can't\n",
      "you think of no way?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain't regular. Come up the stairs, and\n",
      "let on it's a lightning-rod.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,\n",
      "for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I\n",
      "hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin\n",
      "plates. Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see\n",
      "the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel\n",
      "and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and\n",
      "he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says:\n",

      "decide on any of them yet. Said we'd got to post Jim first.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\n",
      "one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\n",
      "Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we\n",
      "whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\n",
      "the job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and\n",
      "pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\n",
      "and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\n",

      "honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\n",

      "unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\n",
      "and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and\n",
      "not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\n",
      "So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\n",

      "him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt\n",
      "Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and\n",
      "both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\n",

      "\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\n",

      "we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them\n",

      "what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\n",
      "his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn't see\n",
      "no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\n",
      "better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\n",

      "\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\n",
      "keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\n",
      "get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\n",
      "more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out\n",
      "to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he\n",
      "said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\n",

      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\n",

      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked\n",

      "over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\n",

      "and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back\n",
      "again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.\n",

      "the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other,\n",
      "looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went a mooning around,\n",
      "first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all.\n",

      "we'd got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out\n",
      "he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the\n",
      "spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to\n",
      "counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of\n",

      "“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I counted\n",
      "'m myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody\n",
      "would.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!” she says.  “Why, what in\n",
      "the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!” and she looked huffy\n",
      "and bothered both. But Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know, but--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I'll count 'm _again_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\n",
      "Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so\n",
      "mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start\n",
      "to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\n",
      "come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed\n",
      "up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\n",
      "galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if\n",
      "we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin\n",
      "us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\n",
      "she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\n",
      "with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with\n",
      "this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\n",
      "because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike\n",
      "again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if\n",
      "she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the\n",
      "next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody\n",
      "that wanted her to ever count them any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\n",
      "soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\n",
      "she druther die first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would\n",
      "blow over by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\n",
      "had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\n",
      "we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\n",

      "nest, but we didn't. The family was at home. We didn't give it right\n",
      "up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd\n",
      "tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we\n",
      "got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right\n",
      "again, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes,\n",
      "and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in\n",
      "a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and\n",
      "a rattling good honest day's work: and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!\n",
      "And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't\n",
      "half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn't\n",
      "matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So\n",
      "we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn't no real\n",
      "scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You'd see\n",
      "them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they\n",
      "generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most\n",
      "of the time where you didn't want them. Well, they was handsome and\n",
      "striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never\n",
      "made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what\n",
      "they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and\n",
      "every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference\n",
      "what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I\n",
      "never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You\n",
      "couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if\n",
      "she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a\n",
      "howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old\n",
      "man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes\n",
      "created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the\n",
      "house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't\n",
      "near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could\n",
      "touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump\n",
      "right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all\n",
      "women was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or\n",
      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she\n",
      "allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever\n",
      "loaded up the place again with them. I didn't mind the lickings,\n",
      "because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we\n",
      "had to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other\n",
      "things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd\n",
      "all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn't like the spiders,\n",
      "and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it\n",
      "mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes\n",
      "and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and\n",
      "when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was\n",
      "always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but\n",
      "took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and\n",
      "when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one\n",
      "gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,\n",
      "and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at\n",
      "him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't\n",
      "ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.\n",
      "The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he\n",
      "would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;\n",
      "the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the\n",
      "grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,\n",
      "and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was all\n",
      "going to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever\n",
      "see; and Tom said the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was\n",
      "all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote\n",
      "a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their\n",
      "runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such\n",
      "plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and\n",
      "New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me\n",
      "the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now\n",
      "for the nonnamous letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's them?” I says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done one\n",
      "way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around that\n",
      "gives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going\n",
      "to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it. It's a very good\n",
      "way, and so is the nonnamous letters. We'll use them both. And it's\n",
      "usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she\n",
      "stays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We'll do that, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that\n",
      "something's up? Let them find it out for themselves--it's their\n",
      "lookout.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've acted\n",
      "from the very start--left us to do _everything_. They're so confiding\n",
      "and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all. So if we\n",
      "don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere\n",
      "with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go\n",

      "“Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I ain't going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits\n",
      "me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that\n",

      "\n",
      "“I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the\n",

      "\n",
      "“All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my\n",

      "\n",
      "“You wouldn't look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That ain't got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is just\n",

      "not. Hain't you got no principle at all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. Who's Jim's\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not much. I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed\n",
      "to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's\n",
      "gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together. When a\n",
      "prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. It's always called\n",
      "so when a king escapes, f'rinstance. And the same with a king's son;\n",
      "it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's\n",
      "frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the\n",

      "she jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened to touch her, when she\n",
      "warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be\n",
      "satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every\n",

      "before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it\n",

      "to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down the\n",
      "lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,\n",

      "about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her\n",
      "back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good\n",

      "\n",
      "So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as\n",
      "a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of\n",
      "corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs\n",
      "very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes\n",
      "Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped\n",

      "s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat\n",
      "about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,\n",

      "My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them\n",

      "didn't take my hat off, all the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if\n",

      "you till morning!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,\n",
      "and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn't hardly get my\n",

      "with guns!\n",
      "\n",

      "again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hurry! _Hurry_!” I says.  “Where's Jim?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.\n",
      "He's dressed, and everything's ready. Now we'll slide out and give the\n",
      "sheep-signal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\n",
      "begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.\n",
      "Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the\n",
      "dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,\n",
      "and listen if you can hear 'em coming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on\n",
      "us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all\n",
      "right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,\n",
      "and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders. Now we was in the\n",
      "lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the door,\n",
      "and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make\n",
      "out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen\n",
      "for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out\n",
      "first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and\n",
      "listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all\n",
      "the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,\n",
      "not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\n",
      "towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\n",
      "over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top\n",
      "rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which\n",
      "snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks\n",
      "and started somebody sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there\n",
      "was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed\n",

      "till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\n",
      "go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But\n",
      "I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\n",

      "\n",
      "I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix\n",

      "silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home\n",
      "in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,\n",
      "and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her\n",
      "good, and she was in so much trouble. And when she was going away she\n",

      "eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do\n",
      "something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never\n",
      "do nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time I waked up at\n",

      "The old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no\n",
      "track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying\n",
      "nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not\n",
      "eating anything. And by and by the old man says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did I give you the letter?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had\n",
      "laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. But\n",
      "before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see\n",
      "something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old\n",
      "doctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;\n",
      "and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come\n",
      "handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,\n",

      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's alive, thank God! And that's enough!” and she snatched a kiss of\n",
      "him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders\n",
      "right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue\n",
      "could go, every jump of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the\n",
      "old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men\n",
      "was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to\n",
      "all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run\n",
      "away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a\n",
      "whole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others\n",
      "said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and\n",
      "his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled\n",
      "them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious\n",
      "for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very\n",
      "ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their\n",
      "satisfaction out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the\n",

      "know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes\n",
      "on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to\n",
      "a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and\n",
      "both legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to\n",
      "eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because\n",
      "he didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and\n",
      "said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the\n",
      "cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and\n",
      "about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with\n",
      "a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and\n",
      "takes a look, and says:\n",

      "me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little\n",
      "worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let\n",
      "me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill\n",
      "me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do\n",

      "the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says\n",
      "he'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I\n",
      "judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had\n",
      "to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It\n",
      "was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and\n",
      "of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,\n",
      "because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet\n",
      "never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick\n",
      "plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a\n",
      "better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,\n",
      "and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked\n",
      "main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a\n",
      "nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too. I\n",
      "had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he\n",
      "would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I\n",
      "_was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about\n",
      "dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck\n",
      "would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped\n",
      "on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped\n",
      "up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was\n",
      "about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a\n",
      "flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and\n",
      "towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least\n",

      "that's what I think about him.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful\n",
      "to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was\n",
      "according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good\n",
      "heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they\n",
      "all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some\n",
      "notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right out\n",
      "and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he\n",
      "could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten\n",
      "heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\n",
      "didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but\n",
      "I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as\n",
      "soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of\n",
      "me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot\n",
      "when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling\n",
      "around hunting the runaway nigger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day\n",

      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt\n",

      "found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that\n",
      "would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and\n",
      "pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and\n",
      "laid for him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding\n",
      "in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and\n",
      "set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful\n",
      "now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping\n",
      "like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the\n",
      "time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his\n",
      "eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:\n",

      "“Hello!--why, I'm at _home_! How's that? Where's the raft?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“The same,” I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. But he never\n",
      "noticed, but says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good! Splendid! _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  “About what, Sid?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“What whole thing?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Good land! Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about! Dear, dear,\n",

      "\n",
      "“_No_, I ain't out of my _head_; I know all what I'm talking about. We\n",
      "_did_ set him free--me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.\n",
      "And we done it elegant, too.” He'd got a start, and she never checked\n",
      "him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and\n",
      "I see it warn't no use for _me_ to put in.  “Why, Aunty, it cost us a\n",
      "power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was\n",
      "all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,\n",
      "and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the\n",
      "warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,\n",

      "inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think _half_ the\n",
      "fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,\n",
      "and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the\n",
      "lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder\n",
      "and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work\n",
      "with in your apron pocket--”\n",
      "\n",

      "we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let\n",
      "drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let\n",
      "them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but\n",
      "went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the\n",
      "raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was\n",

      "death. I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out\n",

      "“What _does_ the child mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, _I'll_\n",
      "go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss\n",
      "Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to\n",
      "sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her\n",
      "will.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women! Why,\n",

      "\n",
      "If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as\n",
      "sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and\n",
      "cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,\n",
      "for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped\n",
      "out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and\n",
      "stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding\n",
      "him into the earth, you know. And then she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, you _better_ turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “_Is_ he changed so? Why, that ain't\n",
      "_Tom_, it's Sid; Tom's--Tom's--why, where is Tom? He was here a minute\n",
      "ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean where's Huck _Finn_--that's what you mean! I reckon I hain't\n",

      "\n",
      "So I done it. But not feeling brash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever\n",
      "see--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told\n",
      "it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't\n",
      "know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting\n",
      "sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the\n",
      "oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it. So Tom's Aunt Polly,\n",
      "she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how\n",
      "I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom\n",
      "Sawyer--she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm\n",
      "used to it now, and 'tain't no need to change”--that when Aunt Sally took\n",
      "me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, and\n",
      "I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being\n",
      "a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly\n",
      "satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made\n",
      "things as soft as he could for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting\n",
      "Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took\n",
      "all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't\n",
      "ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_\n",
      "help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and\n",
      "_Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that\n",
      "way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all\n",
      "the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that\n",
      "creetur's up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any\n",
      "answer out of you about it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, I never got 'em, Sis.”\n",
      "\n",

      "You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\r\n",
      "Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made\r\n",
      "by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things\r\n",
      "which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I\r\n",
      "never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\r\n",
      "Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\r\n",
      "is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\r\n",
      "is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money\r\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six\r\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when\r\n",
      "it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\r\n",
      "at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\r\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas\r\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\r\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\r\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\r\n",
      "it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\r\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\r\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\r\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\r\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\r\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\r\n",
      "sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing\r\n",
      "commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\r\n",
      "to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\r\n",
      "you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\r\n",
      "over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\r\n",
      "them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a\r\n",
      "barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\r\n",
      "juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\r\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\r\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\r\n",
      "then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\r\n",
      "dead people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she\r\n",
      "wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\r\n",
      "try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They\r\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she was\r\n",
      "a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\r\n",
      "being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\r\n",
      "thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that\r\n",
      "was all right, because she done it herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\r\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\r\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\r\n",
      "the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for\r\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,\r\n",
      "“Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don't scrunch up\r\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would\r\n",
      "say, “Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\r\n",
      "behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\r\n",
      "I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted\r\n",
      "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\r\n",
      "She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\r\n",
      "the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\r\n",
      "Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\r\n",
      "made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it\r\n",
      "would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\r\n",
      "place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\r\n",
      "day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think\r\n",
      "much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\r\n",
      "would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad\r\n",
      "about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\r\n",
      "By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\r\n",
      "everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\r\n",
      "and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and\r\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt\r\n",
      "so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the\r\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\r\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\r\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\r\n",
      "to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\r\n",
      "it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\r\n",
      "that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\r\n",
      "something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\r\n",
      "can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\r\n",
      "grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\r\n",
      "company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\r\n",
      "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\r\n",
      "was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\r\n",
      "an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\r\n",
      "and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\r\n",
      "tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\r\n",
      "up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But\r\n",
      "I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\r\n",
      "you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\r\n",
      "heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\r\n",
      "a spider.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\r\n",
      "for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\r\n",
      "know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\r\n",
      "go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\r\n",
      "ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\r\n",
      "trees--something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I\r\n",
      "could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. That was good!\r\n",
      "Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the\r\n",
      "light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped\r\n",
      "down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\r\n",
      "there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\r\n",
      "the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\r\n",
      "heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\r\n",
      "a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big nigger,\r\n",
      "named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\r\n",
      "clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched\r\n",
      "his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who dah?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\r\n",
      "between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was\r\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\r\n",
      "together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\r\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\r\n",
      "right between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\r\n",
      "Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with\r\n",
      "the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\r\n",
      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\r\n",
      "you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\r\n",
      "says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\r\n",
      "Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down here and\r\n",
      "listen tell I hears it agin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up\r\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\r\n",
      "one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into\r\n",
      "my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside.\r\n",
      "Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set\r\n",
      "still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\r\n",
      "it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different\r\n",
      "places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\r\n",
      "but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun\r\n",
      "to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\r\n",
      "comfortable again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\r\n",
      "went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom\r\n",
      "whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said\r\n",
      "no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\r\n",
      "warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\r\n",
      "in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I said Jim\r\n",
      "might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\r\n",
      "and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\r\n",
      "Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\r\n",
      "Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\r\n",
      "something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\r\n",
      "so still and lonesome.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\r\n",
      "and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\r\n",
      "the house. Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\r\n",
      "on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\r\n",
      "Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\r\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\r\n",
      "and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told\r\n",
      "it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\r\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\r\n",
      "rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\r\n",
      "was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\r\n",
      "got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come\r\n",
      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\r\n",
      "nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\r\n",
      "open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is\r\n",
      "always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\r\n",
      "whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\r\n",
      "Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know 'bout witches?” and\r\n",
      "that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept\r\n",
      "that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\r\n",
      "charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\r\n",
      "cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\r\n",
      "saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\r\n",
      "Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\r\n",
      "had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\r\n",
      "it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for\r\n",
      "a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\r\n",
      "and been rode by witches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\r\n",
      "into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\r\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\r\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\r\n",
      "awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\r\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\r\n",
      "So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\r\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\r\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\r\n",
      "part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\r\n",
      "hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\r\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\r\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. We\r\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\r\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\r\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\r\n",
      "in blood.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\r\n",
      "wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the\r\n",
      "band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\r\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\r\n",
      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\r\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\r\n",
      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\r\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\r\n",
      "killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\r\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\r\n",
      "ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\r\n",
      "blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\r\n",
      "and be forgot forever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\r\n",
      "it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\r\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\r\n",
      "the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\r\n",
      "it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\r\n",
      "him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, hain't he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He\r\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen\r\n",
      "in these parts for a year or more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\r\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\r\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of\r\n",
      "anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready\r\n",
      "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\r\n",
      "Watson--they could kill her. Everybody said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\r\n",

      "loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,\r\n",
      "and elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He\r\n",
      "said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I\r\n",
      "would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He\r\n",

      "cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and\r\n",
      "dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my\r\n",
      "shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick\r\n",
      "as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and\r\n",
      "dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a\r\n",

      "shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\r\n",
      "with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee and\r\n",
      "sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\r\n",
      "bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\r\n",
      "blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and\r\n",
      "matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned\r\n",
      "out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\r\n",
      "at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched\r\n",
      "out the gun, and now I was done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\r\n",

      "sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\r\n",
      "rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\r\n",

      "followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the\r\n",
      "river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\r\n",
      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\r\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\r\n",
      "farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it\r\n",
      "considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\r\n",
      "to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\r\n",
      "on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\r\n",
      "and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\r\n",
      "in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\r\n",
      "the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\r\n",
      "down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been\r\n",
      "dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\r\n",
      "would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\r\n",

      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\r\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I\r\n",
      "took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\r\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\r\n",
      "the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag\r\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\r\n",
      "I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\r\n",
      "bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\r\n",
      "place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then\r\n",
      "I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\r\n",
      "the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\r\n",
      "and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There\r\n",
      "was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\r\n",
      "miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. The meal\r\n",
      "sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped\r\n",
      "pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\r\n",
      "accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\r\n",
      "wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\r\n",
      "willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I\r\n",
      "made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\r\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself,\r\n",
      "they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\r\n",
      "drag the river for me. And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\r\n",
      "and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\r\n",
      "that killed me and took the things. They won't ever hunt the river for\r\n",
      "anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\r\n",
      "bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\r\n",
      "Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\r\n",
      "and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights,\r\n",
      "and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the\r\n",
      "place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When\r\n",
      "I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked\r\n",
      "around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and\r\n",
      "miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\r\n",
      "that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\r\n",
      "shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\r\n",
      "You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\r\n",
      "when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I\r\n",
      "made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\r\n",
      "oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. I peeped out through\r\n",
      "the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\r\n",
      "I couldn't tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was\r\n",
      "abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it. Think's I, maybe\r\n",
      "it's pap, though I warn't expecting him. He dropped below me with the\r\n",
      "current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\r\n",
      "and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\r\n",
      "Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\r\n",
      "oars.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\r\n",
      "soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half,\r\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\r\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\r\n",
      "people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and\r\n",
      "then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\r\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when\r\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\r\n",
      "And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people\r\n",
      "talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\r\n",
      "of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\r\n",
      "nights now. T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\r\n",
      "reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\r\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\r\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\r\n",
      "let him alone. The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\r\n",
      "old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\r\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\r\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\r\n",
      "about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away,\r\n",
      "and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\r\n",
      "and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson's\r\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\r\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\r\n",
      "a steamboat without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar at\r\n",
      "the head--it was all under water now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping\r\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\r\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into\r\n",
      "a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\r\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\r\n",
      "from the outside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\r\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\r\n",
      "three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A\r\n",
      "monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\r\n",
      "with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down,\r\n",
      "and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern\r\n",
      "oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!” I heard that just as plain\r\n",
      "as if the man was by my side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\r\n",
      "o'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\r\n",
      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I\r\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\r\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places\r\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\r\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\r\n",
      "breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\r\n",
      "very friendly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\r\n",
      "breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\r\n",
      "sound of “boom!” away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\r\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and\r\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\r\n",
      "on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry. And there was the\r\n",
      "ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the\r\n",
      "matter now.  “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\r\n",
      "side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\r\n",
      "carcass come to the top.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\r\n",
      "because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the\r\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there,\r\n",
      "and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\r\n",
      "enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\r\n",
      "eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\r\n",
      "loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\r\n",
      "drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\r\n",
      "if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show. I\r\n",
      "changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\r\n",
      "have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I\r\n",
      "most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\r\n",
      "further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\r\n",
      "shore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one,\r\n",
      "and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\r\n",
      "of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was “baker's bread”--what the\r\n",
      "quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\r\n",
      "the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And\r\n",
      "then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\r\n",
      "or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\r\n",
      "and done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\r\n",
      "thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\r\n",
      "parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\r\n",
      "only just the right kind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The\r\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\r\n",
      "to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\r\n",
      "close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along down\r\n",
      "towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\r\n",
      "and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where\r\n",
      "the log forked I could peep through.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\r\n",
      "a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.\r\n",
      "Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\r\n",
      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\r\n",
      "Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\r\n",
      "says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\r\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge. I\r\n",
      "hope so, anyway.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\r\n",
      "in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see\r\n",
      "them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\r\n",
      "it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\r\n",
      "I judged I was gone. If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\r\n",
      "a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\r\n",
      "goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\r\n",
      "of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and\r\n",
      "further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\r\n",
      "The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and\r\n",
      "was giving it up. But they didn't yet a while. They turned around\r\n",
      "the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\r\n",
      "under steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over\r\n",
      "to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\r\n",
      "island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\r\n",
      "went home to the town.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after\r\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\r\n",
      "woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\r\n",
      "under so the rain couldn't get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled\r\n",
      "him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\r\n",
      "supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\r\n",
      "satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\r\n",
      "on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\r\n",
      "stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\r\n",
      "there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\r\n",
      "can't stay so, you soon get over it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so for three days and nights. No difference--just the same thing.\r\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was\r\n",
      "boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\r\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty\r\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\r\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They\r\n",
      "would all come handy by and by, I judged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\r\n",
      "far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\r\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\r\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\r\n",
      "and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\r\n",
      "it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\r\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look\r\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\r\n",
      "fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\r\n",
      "thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\r\n",
      "nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\r\n",
      "and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\r\n",
      "on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\r\n",
      "breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\r\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I\r\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\r\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\r\n",
      "old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\r\n",
      "I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\r\n",
      "thousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\r\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\r\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\r\n",
      "breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good\r\n",
      "and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\r\n",
      "Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and\r\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\r\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\r\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. I got\r\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\r\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn't got far when I\r\n",
      "hear a man say:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\r\n",
      "beat out. Let's look around.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the\r\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time\r\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn't\r\n",
      "do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\r\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\r\n",
      "find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\r\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was\r\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\r\n",
      "I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\r\n",
      "asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A\r\n",
      "little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\r\n",
      "the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung\r\n",
      "her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\r\n",
      "of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\r\n",
      "leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\r\n",
      "the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\r\n",
      "and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards\r\n",
      "where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\r\n",
      "to listen. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the\r\n",
      "place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\r\n",
      "through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was\r\n",
      "close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It\r\n",
      "most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\r\n",
      "head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in\r\n",
      "about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting\r\n",
      "gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\r\n",
      "off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see\r\n",
      "him. I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees,\r\n",
      "and puts his hands together and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "wide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\r\n",
      "high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\r\n",
      "the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\r\n",
      "and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\r\n",
      "side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\r\n",
      "bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in\r\n",
      "there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\r\n",
      "didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\r\n",
      "in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\r\n",
      "and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them\r\n",
      "little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\r\n",
      "get wet?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\r\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by\r\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off\r\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\r\n",

      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\r\n",
      "side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\r\n",
      "good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\r\n",
      "We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty\r\n",

      "right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\r\n",
      "too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular\r\n",
      "summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\r\n",

      "the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\r\n",
      "come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\r\n",
      "pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\r\n",
      "follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\r\n",

      "blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little\r\n",

      "hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\r\n",

      "me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the\r\n",
      "body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it\r\n",
      "would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around\r\n",

      "as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\r\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us\r\n",
      "into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\r\n",
      "till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\r\n",
      "ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,\r\n",
      "and there was a spool in it. Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to\r\n",
      "coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever\r\n",
      "catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn't ever seen\r\n",
      "a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\r\n",
      "They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house\r\n",

      "Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\r\n",

      "find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I\r\n",
      "must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,\r\n",
      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\r\n",
      "That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico\r\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim\r\n",
      "hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the\r\n",
      "sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\r\n",
      "and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said\r\n",
      "nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around\r\n",
      "all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\r\n",

      "few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in\r\n",
      "the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to\r\n",
      "that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't anybody\r\n",
      "live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say any more, but\r\n",
      "I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over\r\n",
      "there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says\r\n",

      "it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman\r\n",
      "stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious\r\n",
      "and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to\r\n",
      "be interested--and I was, too--and says:\r\n",

      "couldn't look up yet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor\r\n",
      "they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the\r\n",
      "place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right\r\n",
      "about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner\r\n",
      "every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at\r\n",
      "them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She showed\r\n",
      "me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot\r\n",
      "with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't\r\n",
      "know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance,\r\n",
      "and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\r\n",
      "“Ouch!” it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one.\r\n",
      "I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course\r\n",
      "I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his\r\n",
      "nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a\r\n",
      "tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\r\n",
      "would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\r\n",
      "it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\r\n",
      "her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\r\n",
      "went on talking about her and her husband's matters. But she broke off\r\n",
      "to say:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap,\r\n",
      "handy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a\r\n",
      "minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\r\n",
      "and very pleasant, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, now, what's your real name?”\r\n",

      "go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead,\r\n",
      "and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty\r\n",
      "mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it\r\n",
      "no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\r\n",
      "chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and\r\n",
      "I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights,\r\n",
      "and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\r\n",
      "home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my\r\n",
      "uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck\r\n",
      "out for this town of Goshen.\r\n",

      "head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but\r\n",

      "a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half\r\n",
      "below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber\r\n",
      "and up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on\r\n",

      "that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was\r\n",
      "ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We\r\n",

      "along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\r\n",
      "shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\r\n",
      "put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We\r\n",

      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\r\n",
      "big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\r\n",
      "the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\r\n",
      "had been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has\r\n",
      "cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\r\n",
      "side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\r\n",
      "warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day,\r\n",
      "and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\r\n",
      "up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all\r\n",
      "about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\r\n",
      "a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\r\n",
      "down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. Well, then, I\r\n",
      "said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he\r\n",
      "bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\r\n",
      "believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\r\n",
      "time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\r\n",
      "below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\r\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\r\n",
      "so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\r\n",
      "wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\r\n",
      "dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\r\n",
      "the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\r\n",
      "reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\r\n",
      "layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\r\n",
      "to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\r\n",
      "or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra\r\n",
      "steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\r\n",
      "or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\r\n",
      "on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\r\n",
      "coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\r\n",
      "to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\r\n",
      "a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\r\n",

      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\r\n",
      "up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\r\n",
      "warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle. We\r\n",
      "had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\r\n",

      "there; everybody was asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\r\n",
      "village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\r\n",
      "stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\r\n",
      "comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when\r\n",
      "you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\r\n",

      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\r\n",

      "was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\r\n",
      "anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\r\n",
      "Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\r\n",
      "right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\r\n",
      "from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned\r\n",
      "it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all\r\n",
      "one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\r\n",
      "whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\r\n",
      "or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\r\n",
      "concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We warn't feeling just\r\n",
      "right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way\r\n",
      "it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\r\n",

      "looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\r\n",
      "We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very\r\n",

      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\r\n",
      "in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\r\n",

      "“'Deed you _ain't!_ You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet\r\n",

      "best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both. And what _for_? Jist\r\n",
      "for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for. But\r\n",

      "and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up\r\n",
      "in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there,\r\n",
      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see\r\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\r\n",
      "I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\r\n",
      "anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I\r\n",
      "didn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body _couldn't_\r\n",
      "breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted\r\n",
      "to kill Turner. He says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares\r\n",

      "you hear _me_. I'm for putting him out of his troubles.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So'm I,” says Packard, very quiet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's all\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever\r\n",
      "pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide\r\n",
      "the truck. Then we'll wait. Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two\r\n",
      "hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See?\r\n",
      "He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own\r\n",
      "self. I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.\r\n",
      "I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it\r\n",
      "ain't good sense, it ain't good morals. Ain't I right?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I reck'n you are. But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“All right, then; come along.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled\r\n",

      "whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a\r\n",
      "moan, and I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a\r\n",

      "Quick--hurry! I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You\r\n",
      "start at the raft, and--”\r\n",

      "Well, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with\r\n",
      "such a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd\r\n",
      "_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went\r\n",
      "a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\r\n",
      "too--seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim\r\n",
      "said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't\r\n",
      "hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left\r\n",
      "on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck\r\n",
      "for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\r\n",
      "forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the\r\n",
      "edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the\r\n",
      "cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely\r\n",
      "see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been\r\n",
      "aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his\r\n",
      "head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;\r\n",
      "but he jerked it in again, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and\r\n",
      "set down. It was Packard. Then Bill _he_ come out and got in. Packard\r\n",
      "says, in a low voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All ready--shove off!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Hold on--'d you go through him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No. Didn't you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Maybe he won't. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they got out and went in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half\r\n",
      "second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with my\r\n",
      "knife and cut the rope, and away we went!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even\r\n",
      "breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the\r\n",
      "paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a\r\n",
      "hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every\r\n",
      "last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern\r\n",
      "show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed\r\n",
      "by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to\r\n",
      "understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the\r\n",
      "first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't\r\n",
      "had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for\r\n",
      "murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain't no\r\n",
      "telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would\r\n",
      "I like it? So says I to Jim:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above\r\n",
      "it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and\r\n",
      "then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for\r\n",
      "that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when\r\n",
      "their time comes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,\r\n",
      "and this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light\r\n",
      "showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river,\r\n",
      "watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the\r\n",
      "rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,\r\n",
      "and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we\r\n",
      "made for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We\r\n",
      "seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would\r\n",
      "go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole\r\n",
      "there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told\r\n",
      "Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone\r\n",
      "about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars\r\n",
      "and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four more\r\n",
      "showed--up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore\r\n",
      "light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it was a\r\n",
      "lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I skimmed\r\n",
      "around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and\r\n",
      "by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between\r\n",
      "his knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to\r\n",
      "cry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only\r\n",
      "me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hello, what's up? Don't cry, bub. What's the trouble?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "somebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me\r\n",
      "yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its\r\n",
      "place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,\r\n",
      "and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down-stream, and I\r\n",
      "was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.\r\n",
      "I couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't look\r\n",
      "natural nor sound natural in a fog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a\r\n",
      "cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed\r\n",
      "me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly\r\n",
      "roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set\r\n",

      "draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank\r\n",
      "was an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it. It warn't no\r\n",
      "towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber\r\n",

      "half a mile wide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I\r\n",
      "was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don't\r\n",
      "ever think of that. No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on\r\n",

      "the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't do\r\n",
      "it, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I had\r\n",
      "little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow\r\n",
      "channel between, and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there because\r\n",
      "I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash\r\n",
      "that hung over the banks. Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops down\r\n",
      "amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,\r\n",
      "anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern. You never\r\n",
      "knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to\r\n",
      "keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the\r\n",
      "raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would\r\n",
      "get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little\r\n",
      "faster than what I was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't\r\n",
      "hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a\r\n",
      "snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I\r\n",
      "laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more. I didn't\r\n",
      "want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn't help it;\r\n",
      "so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars\r\n",
      "was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a\r\n",
      "big bend stern first. First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was\r\n",

      "up dim out of last week.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see\r\n",
      "by the stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the\r\n",
      "water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but a\r\n",
      "couple of sawlogs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "branches and dirt. So she'd had a rough time.\r\n",

      "We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a\r\n",

      "four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty\r\n",
      "men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open\r\n",

      "talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to\r\n",

      "more. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next\r\n",
      "meanest thing to fog. You can't tell the shape of the river, and you\r\n",
      "can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\r\n",
      "comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she\r\n",
      "was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see\r\n",
      "how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\r\n",
      "a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\r\n",
      "he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\r\n",
      "try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She\r\n",
      "was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\r\n",
      "cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged\r\n",
      "out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\r\n",
      "like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\r\n",
      "over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\r\n",
      "engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went\r\n",
      "overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight\r\n",

      "always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\r\n",
      "minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\r\n",
      "nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\r\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and\r\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\r\n",
      "stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\r\n",
      "churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I\r\n",
      "could hear her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;\r\n",
      "so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” and\r\n",
      "struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see\r\n",
      "that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\r\n",
      "meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\r\n",
      "long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\r\n",
      "bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\r\n",
      "rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\r\n",
      "big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't\r\n",

      "of yours that's dry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,\r\n",
      "though he was a little bigger than me. He hadn't on anything but a\r\n",
      "shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one\r\n",
      "fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.\r\n",
      "He says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.\r\n",

      "“Well,” he says, “if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all laughed, and Bob says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in\r\n",
      "coming.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept down; I\r\n",
      "don't get no show.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you'll have show enough,\r\n",
      "all in good time, don't you fret about that. Go 'long with you now, and\r\n",
      "do as your mother told you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a\r\n",
      "roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he\r\n",
      "asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to\r\n",
      "tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods\r\n",
      "day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet\r\n",
      "I don't, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon\r\n",

      "had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've\r\n",
      "come across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,\r\n",
      "except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. They\r\n",
      "all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had\r\n",
      "quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me\r\n",
      "questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living\r\n",
      "on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann\r\n",
      "run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went\r\n",
      "to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,\r\n",
      "and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just\r\n",
      "trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died\r\n",
      "I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and\r\n",
      "started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how\r\n",
      "I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I\r\n",
      "wanted it. Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I\r\n",
      "went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,\r\n",
      "I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to\r\n",
      "think, and when Buck waked up I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you spell, Buck?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“All right,” says I, “go ahead.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,” he says.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn't think you could. It ain't no\r\n",
      "slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it\r\n",

      "It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn't\r\n",
      "seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much\r\n",
      "style. It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one\r\n",
      "with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in\r\n",
      "town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\r\n",
      "of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that\r\n",
      "was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\r\n",
      "pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\r\n",
      "they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\r\n",
      "same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\r\n",
      "up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\r\n",
      "a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\r\n",
      "a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\r\n",
      "pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;\r\n",
      "and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\r\n",
      "up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\r\n",
      "and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn't took any money for\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\r\n",
      "made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the\r\n",
      "parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;\r\n",
      "and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open\r\n",
      "their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through\r\n",
      "underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\r\n",
      "behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\r\n",
      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\r\n",
      "grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\r\n",
      "than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\r\n",
      "pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it\r\n",
      "was, underneath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\r\n",
      "blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It\r\n",
      "come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books,\r\n",
      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a\r\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\r\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why. I read considerable in it\r\n",
      "now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was\r\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\r\n",
      "read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\r\n",
      "Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\r\n",
      "was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. And\r\n",
      "there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\r\n",
      "down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\r\n",
      "and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the\r\n",
      "Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the\r\n",
      "daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\r\n",
      "fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see\r\n",
      "before--blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black\r\n",
      "dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\r\n",
      "the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\r\n",
      "a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\r\n",
      "very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\r\n",
      "tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\r\n",
      "hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\r\n",
      "and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”\r\n",
      " Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\r\n",
      "to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\r\n",
      "chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\r\n",
      "laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\r\n",
      "the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”\r\n",
      " There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\r\n",
      "moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\r\n",
      "one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\r\n",
      "mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath\r\n",
      "the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” These\r\n",
      "was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\r\n",
      "to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\r\n",
      "fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\r\n",
      "more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\r\n",
      "what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\r\n",
      "having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they\r\n",
      "said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\r\n",
      "every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\r\n",
      "done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman\r\n",
      "in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\r\n",
      "off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\r\n",
      "the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\r\n",
      "breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\r\n",
      "towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\r\n",
      "and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\r\n",
      "before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\r\n",
      "head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\r\n",
      "flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young\r\n",
      "woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\r\n",
      "many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\r\n",
      "obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\r\n",
      "Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\r\n",
      "It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name\r\n",
      "of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "No; such was not the fate of  Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad\r\n",
      "hearts round him thickened,   'Twas not from sickness' shots.\r\n",

      "Despised love struck not with woe  That head of curly knots, Nor\r\n",
      "stomach troubles laid him low,  Young Stephen Dowling Bots.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "O no. Then list with tearful eye,  Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul\r\n",
      "did from this cold world fly  By falling down a well.\r\n",

      "said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't ever have to\r\n",
      "stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't\r\n",
      "find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down\r\n",
      "another one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write about\r\n",

      "Whistler. She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,\r\n",

      "out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been\r\n",

      "family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between\r\n",
      "us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was\r\n",
      "alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some\r\n",
      "about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\r\n",
      "myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline's\r\n",
      "room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she\r\n",

      "The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty\r\n",

      "so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all\r\n",
      "over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and\r\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\r\n",
      "said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\r\n",
      "in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more\r\n",
      "quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and\r\n",
      "very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\r\n",
      "anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\r\n",
      "he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\r\n",
      "a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\r\n",
      "deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\r\n",
      "you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\r\n",
      "straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\r\n",
      "every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\r\n",
      "to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\r\n",
      "and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He\r\n",
      "carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn't no\r\n",
      "frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud. He was\r\n",
      "as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\r\n",
      "confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\r\n",
      "straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\r\n",
      "flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\r\n",
      "and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn't ever have to\r\n",
      "tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\r\n",
      "where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\r\n",
      "most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned\r\n",
      "into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\r\n",
      "enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.\r\n",

      "When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got\r\n",
      "up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again\r\n",
      "till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where\r\n",
      "the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and\r\n",
      "he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and\r\n",
      "then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and _they_\r\n",
      "bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,\r\n",
      "all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and\r\n",
      "the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and\r\n",

      "his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this\r\n",

      "was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they'd got across\r\n",
      "the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take\r\n",
      "on because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I\r\n",
      "hain't ever heard anything like it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,\r\n",
      "they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put\r\n",
      "in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\r\n",
      "and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\r\n",
      "night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\r\n",
      "in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\r\n",
      "willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next\r\n",
      "we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\r\n",
      "off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\r\n",
      "deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres--perfectly\r\n",
      "still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\r\n",
      "a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the\r\n",
      "water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you\r\n",
      "couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\r\n",
      "paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\r\n",
      "warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\r\n",
      "drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\r\n",
      "long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\r\n",
      "jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\r\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\r\n",
      "streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\r\n",
      "and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\r\n",
      "of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\r\n",
      "log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\r\n",
      "the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\r\n",
      "throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\r\n",
      "comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\r\n",
      "on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\r\n",
      "because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\r\n",
      "do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\r\n",
      "smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\r\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch\r\n",
      "the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\r\n",
      "lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\r\n",
      "maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\r\n",
      "other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\r\n",
      "a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\r\n",
      "nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness. Next\r\n",
      "you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\r\n",
      "chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\r\n",
      "axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\r\n",
      "up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\r\n",
      "_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water. So we\r\n",
      "would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once\r\n",
      "there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\r\n",
      "tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them. A scow or a\r\n",
      "raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\r\n",
      "laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made\r\n",
      "you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.\r\n",
      "Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\r\n",
      "middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\r\n",
      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\r\n",
      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\r\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made\r\n",
      "for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on\r\n",
      "clothes, nohow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\r\n",
      "time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\r\n",
      "a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\r\n",
      "you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\r\n",
      "you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\r\n",
      "It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled\r\n",
      "with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\r\n",
      "discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he\r\n",
      "allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would\r\n",
      "have took too long to _make_ so many. Jim said the moon could a _laid_\r\n",
      "them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing\r\n",
      "against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\r\n",
      "could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\r\n",
      "streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the\r\n",
      "nest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\r\n",
      "dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\r\n",
      "of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\r\n",
      "pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\r\n",
      "her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\r\n",
      "waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\r\n",
      "raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't\r\n",
      "tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\r\n",
      "three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\r\n",
      "These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant\r\n",
      "morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to\r\n",
      "the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile\r\n",
      "up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some\r\n",
      "berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed\r\n",
      "the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as\r\n",
      "they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was\r\n",
      "after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim. I was about to dig out\r\n",
      "from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung\r\n",
      "out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing\r\n",
      "nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs\r\n",
      "a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don't you do it. I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time\r\n",
      "to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you\r\n",
      "take to the water and wade down to me and get in--that'll throw the dogs\r\n",
      "off the scent.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,\r\n",
      "and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,\r\n",
      "shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't\r\n",
      "see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\r\n",
      "further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at\r\n",
      "all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the\r\n",
      "river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid\r\n",
      "in the cottonwoods and was safe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\r\n",

      "a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed\r\n",
      "into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one. He had\r\n",

      "his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.\r\n",

      "The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. After\r\n",

      "a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below we\r\n",
      "hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain\r\n",

      "usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the\r\n",
      "price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.\r\n",
      "He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of\r\n",
      "his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,\r\n",
      "“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”--and he left that all set\r\n",
      "up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged\r\n",
      "for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with\r\n",
      "a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it. The\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and\r\n",

      "ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick\r\n",
      "as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever\r\n",
      "_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I\r\n",
      "couldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year.\r\n",
      "And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to\r\n",
      "ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued\r\n",
      "and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show\r\n",
      "come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make\r\n",
      "fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that\r\n",
      "stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\r\n",
      "benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him\r\n",
      "out!” and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster\r\n",
      "he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no\r\n",
      "disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more\r\n",
      "trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.\r\n",
      "So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute\r\n",
      "he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,\r\n",
      "with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\r\n",
      "drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\r\n",
      "jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\r\n",
      "till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men\r\n",
      "could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,\r\n",
      "round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging\r\n",
      "to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\r\n",
      "and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. It\r\n",
      "warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\r\n",
      "But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,\r\n",
      "a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\r\n",
      "dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\r\n",
      "too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\r\n",
      "as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his\r\n",
      "clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\r\n",
      "the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\r\n",
      "was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\r\n",
      "ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\r\n",
      "hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\r\n",
      "the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\r\n",
      "astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the\r\n",
      "sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own\r\n",
      "men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on\r\n",
      "to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't\r\n",
      "a been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars. I don't\r\n",

      "Next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in\r\n",
      "the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the\r\n",
      "duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim\r\n",
      "he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few\r\n",
      "hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to\r\n",
      "lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him\r\n",
      "all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all\r\n",
      "by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway\r\n",
      "nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\r\n",
      "roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed\r\n",
      "Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\r\n",
      "white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\r\n",
      "and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\r\n",
      "dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days. Blamed if\r\n",
      "he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took\r\n",
      "and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\r\n",
      "foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight\r\n",
      "better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\r\n",
      "over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself\r\n",
      "free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\r\n",
      "out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\r\n",
      "a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\r\n",
      "Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\r\n",
      "wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he was\r\n",
      "dead, he looked considerable more than that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\r\n",
      "so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe\r\n",
      "the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn't hit no\r\n",
      "project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd\r\n",
      "lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up\r\n",
      "something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\r\n",
      "over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\r\n",
      "to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all\r\n",
      "bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n\r\n",
      "on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king's\r\n",
      "duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never\r\n",
      "knowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked\r\n",
      "like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off\r\n",
      "his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\r\n",
      "and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,\r\n",
      "and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I\r\n",
      "got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\r\n",
      "up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple\r\n",
      "of hours, taking on freight. Says the king:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.\r\n",
      "I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went\r\n",
      "scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to\r\n",
      "a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the\r\n",
      "sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a\r\n",
      "couple of big carpet-bags by him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come\r\n",
      "down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\r\n",

      "tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\r\n",
      "a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he\r\n",
      "really done it pretty good. Then he says:\r\n",

      "“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef\r\n",

      "steamboat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\r\n",
      "but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there\r\n",
      "was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went\r\n",
      "aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted\r\n",
      "to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and\r\n",
      "said they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm. He says:\r\n",

      "“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and\r\n",
      "put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the\r\n",

      "they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” they\r\n",
      "give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_\r\n",
      "live yesterday evening.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up\r\n",

      "and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people\r\n",
      "around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done\r\n",
      "it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”\r\n",

      "look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\r\n",
      "right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\r\n",
      "and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\r\n",

      "you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is\r\n",
      "practice. You do it pretty awkward.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "reached out his hand, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often\r\n",
      "about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\r\n",
      "pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side\r\n",
      "and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That 'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your\r\n",
      "brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\r\n",
      "his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\r\n",
      "and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\r\n",
      "duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer\r\n",
      "turns to the new old gentleman and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. The lawyer looked\r\n",
      "powerful astonished, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it beats _me_”--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\r\n",
      "and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\r\n",
      "_them_ again; and then says:  “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\r\n",
      "and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't\r\n",
      "write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\r\n",
      "you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here's _this_ old\r\n",
      "gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't\r\n",
      "write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at\r\n",
      "all. Now, here's some letters from--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The new old gentleman says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother\r\n",
      "there--so he copies for me. It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Well_!” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things. I've got some\r\n",
      "of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we\r\n",
      "can com--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He _can't_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.  “If he\r\n",
      "could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\r\n",
      "and mine too. Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lawyer done it, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\r\n",
      "resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I\r\n",
      "thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\r\n",
      "partly. But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em\r\n",
      "Wilkses”--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\r\n",
      "_then_! Indeed he wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test. Said his\r\n",
      "brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried\r\n",
      "to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\r\n",
      "he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and\r\n",
      "warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\r\n",
      "saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I've thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay\r\n",
      "out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it. We're both here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\r\n",
      "squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\r\n",
      "him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\r\n",
      "most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\r\n",
      "notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\r\n",
      "He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\r\n",
      "there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says\r\n",
      "I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.\r\n",
      "Well, did he? A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't. I reckon\r\n",
      "he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\r\n",
      "they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\r\n",
      "Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mf! It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it! _yes_, sir, I k'n\r\n",
      "tell you what's tattooed on his breast. It's jest a small, thin, blue\r\n",
      "arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.\r\n",
      "_now_ what do you say--hey?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\r\n",
      "cheek.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\r\n",
      "his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and\r\n",
      "says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There--you've heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter\r\n",
      "Wilks' breast?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both of them spoke up and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We didn't see no such mark.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good!” says the old gentleman.  “Now, what you _did_ see on his breast\r\n",
      "was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\r\n",
      "young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P--B--W”--and he marked\r\n",
      "them that way on a piece of paper.  “Come, ain't that what you saw?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both of them spoke up again, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, we _didn't_. We never seen any marks at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds! Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!\r\n",
      "le's ride 'em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there\r\n",
      "was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,\r\n",
      "and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gentlemen--gentle_men!_ Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you\r\n",
      "_please_! There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That took them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\r\n",
      "and the doctor sung out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\r\n",
      "_them_ along, too!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We'll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don't find them marks we'll\r\n",
      "lynch the whole gang!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I _was_ scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you\r\n",
      "know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\r\n",
      "graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\r\n",
      "town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the\r\n",
      "evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;\r\n",

      "blow on our dead-beats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\r\n",
      "wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\r\n",
      "lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst\r\n",
      "the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever\r\n",
      "was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from\r\n",
      "what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time\r\n",
      "if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to\r\n",
      "save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the\r\n",
      "world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they\r\n",
      "didn't find them--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think\r\n",
      "about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful\r\n",
      "time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\r\n",
      "wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He\r\n",
      "dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\r\n",
      "like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had\r\n",
      "about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't\r\n",
      "thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the\r\n",
      "flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a\r\n",
      "mile off, to borrow one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain\r\n",
      "started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come\r\n",
      "brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took\r\n",
      "no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute\r\n",
      "you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the\r\n",
      "shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the\r\n",
      "dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then\r\n",
      "such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to\r\n",
      "scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it\r\n",
      "was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,\r\n",
      "and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and\r\n",
      "panting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and\r\n",
      "give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit\r\n",
      "out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all\r\n",
      "to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the\r\n",
      "buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of\r\n",
      "the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so\r\n",
      "I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the\r\n",
      "main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and\r\n",
      "set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and\r\n",
      "disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by,\r\n",
      "_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on\r\n",

      "first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough\r\n",

      "missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and\r\n",
      "a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. So at\r\n",
      "last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she\r\n",
      "floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the\r\n",
      "half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in\r\n",

      "over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break\r\n",
      "into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money\r\n",
      "business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an\r\n",
      "agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such\r\n",
      "actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold\r\n",

      "a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told\r\n",
      "us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see\r\n",
      "if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (“House to\r\n",

      "we was to come along.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and\r\n",

      "Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come\r\n",
      "and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_\r\n",
      "change on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and\r\n",
      "hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the\r\n",
      "back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers\r\n",

      "shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like\r\n",
      "a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a\r\n",

      "this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn't\r\n",

      "light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I\r\n",

      "good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\r\n",

      "It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was\r\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\r\n",
      "I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell”--and tore it up.\r\n",

      "It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let\r\n",

      "whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\r\n",
      "which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And\r\n",
      "for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\r\n",
      "and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\r\n",
      "long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\r\n",

      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\r\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\r\n",
      "suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\r\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\r\n",
      "raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the\r\n",
      "night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\r\n",
      "and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\r\n",
      "another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed\r\n",
      "below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\r\n",
      "and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\r\n",
      "sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\r\n",
      "of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\r\n",
      "it, “Phelps's Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\r\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\r\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind,\r\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\r\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\r\n",
      "the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along,\r\n",
      "straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\r\n",
      "the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\r\n",
      "performance--like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I\r\n",
      "was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hel-_lo_! Where'd _you_ come from?” Then he says, kind of glad and\r\n",
      "eager, “Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\r\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\r\n",
      "a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered\r\n",
      "me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\r\n",
      "a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\r\n",
      "and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\r\n",
      "along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\r\n",
      "him. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\r\n",
      "country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we\r\n",
      "fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and\r\n",
      "see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\r\n",
      "leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\r\n",
      "the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\r\n",
      "no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\r\n",
      "cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what _did_ become of the\r\n",
      "raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft. That old fool had\r\n",
      "made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\r\n",
      "the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\r\n",
      "what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\r\n",
      "found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\r\n",
      "shook us, and run off down the river.'”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\r\n",
      "enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\r\n",
      "there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\r\n",
      "shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where's\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\r\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\r\n",
      "money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never\r\n",
      "said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We'd skin him if he done\r\n",
      "that!”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "gone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Sold_ him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, and\r\n",
      "that was my money. Where is he?--I want my nigger.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your\r\n",
      "blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\r\n",
      "Blamed if I think I'd trust you. Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\r\n",
      "before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\r\n",
      "I got to turn out and find my nigger.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\r\n",
      "his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I'll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you'll\r\n",
      "promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\r\n",
      "where to find him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I promised, and he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--” and then he stopped. You see, he\r\n",
      "started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\r\n",
      "study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he\r\n",
      "was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\r\n",
      "the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\r\n",
      "lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days. And I'll start this\r\n",
      "very afternoon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\r\n",
      "neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in\r\n",
      "your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\r\n",
      "_us_, d'ye hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I\r\n",
      "wanted to be left free to work my plans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\r\n",
      "to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\r\n",
      "idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down\r\n",
      "South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\r\n",
      "maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\r\n",
      "getting 'em out. Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\r\n",
      "mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn't look around, but I\r\n",
      "kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out\r\n",
      "at that. I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\r\n",
      "I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'. I\r\n",
      "reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\r\n",
      "around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\r\n",
      "get away. I didn't want no trouble with their kind. I'd seen all I\r\n",

      "all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the\r\n",
      "world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big\r\n",

      "worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man\r\n",
      "as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied,\r\n",
      "and said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it was here,\r\n",

      "this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,\r\n",
      "before everybody. I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all. It was\r\n",
      "outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be\r\n",
      "his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save\r\n",
      "himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:\r\n",

      "more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I\r\n",
      "couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to\r\n",

      "so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't make\r\n",
      "no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by\r\n",
      "in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and\r\n",
      "the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the\r\n",
      "north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just\r\n",
      "one stout board nailed across it. I says:\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That's more _like_,” he says.  “It's real mysterious, and troublesome,\r\n",

      "There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\r\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long\r\n",
      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. The door to it was at\r\n",
      "the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\r\n",
      "searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\r\n",
      "so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down,\r\n",
      "and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\r\n",
      "and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\r\n",
      "with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\r\n",
      "some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\r\n",
      "The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\r\n",
      "the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says;\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out. It 'll take about a week!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have\r\n",
      "to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that\r\n",
      "warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\r\n",
      "climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three\r\n",
      "times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\r\n",
      "busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\r\n",
      "was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this\r\n",
      "time he made the trip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\r\n",
      "to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it\r\n",
      "_was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through\r\n",
      "breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up\r\n",
      "a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\r\n",
      "leaving, the key come from the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\r\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches\r\n",
      "off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\r\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\r\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\r\n",
      "long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so\r\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\r\n",

      "The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you\r\n",
      "heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at\r\n",
      "'im?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got in\r\n",
      "we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure\r\n",
      "enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, _Huck_! En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim\r\n",

      "one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\r\n",
      "Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we\r\n",
      "whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\r\n",
      "the job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and\r\n",
      "pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\r\n",
      "and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\r\n",

      "honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\r\n",
      "hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,\r\n",
      "and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how\r\n",
      "unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\r\n",
      "and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and\r\n",
      "not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\r\n",
      "So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\r\n",
      "times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told\r\n",
      "him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt\r\n",
      "Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and\r\n",
      "both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\r\n",

      "“_Now_ I know how to fix it. We'll send you some things by them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I said, “Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass\r\n",
      "ideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to me; went right\r\n",
      "on. It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\r\n",
      "large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\r\n",
      "lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and\r\n",
      "we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them\r\n",
      "out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her\r\n",
      "apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and\r\n",
      "what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\r\n",
      "his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn't see\r\n",
      "no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\r\n",
      "better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\r\n",
      "as Tom said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\r\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\r\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high\r\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\r\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\r\n",
      "keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\r\n",
      "get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\r\n",
      "more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out\r\n",
      "to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he\r\n",
      "said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\r\n",
      "candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\r\n",
      "his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\r\n",
      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\r\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\r\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\r\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked\r\n",
      "better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only\r\n",
      "just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into\r\n",
      "bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\r\n",
      "couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on\r\n",
      "piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room\r\n",
      "in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to\r\n",
      "door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeled\r\n",
      "over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\r\n",
      "dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,\r\n",

      "again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.\r\n",

      "would.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!” she says.  “Why, what in\r\n",
      "the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I'll count 'm _again_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\r\n",
      "Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so\r\n",
      "mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start\r\n",
      "to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\r\n",
      "come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed\r\n",
      "up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\r\n",
      "galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if\r\n",
      "we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin\r\n",
      "us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\r\n",
      "she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\r\n",
      "with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with\r\n",
      "this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\r\n",
      "because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike\r\n",
      "again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if\r\n",
      "she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the\r\n",
      "next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody\r\n",
      "that wanted her to ever count them any more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\r\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\r\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\r\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\r\n",
      "soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\r\n",
      "she druther die first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\r\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\r\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would\r\n",
      "blow over by and by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We\r\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\r\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\r\n",
      "had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\r\n",
      "we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\r\n",
      "the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we\r\n",
      "couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course\r\n",
      "we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,\r\n",
      "in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore\r\n",
      "up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\r\n",
      "before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person\r\n",
      "with. We let on it took nine months to make it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go\r\n",
      "into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\r\n",
      "enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over\r\n",
      "for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole\r\n",
      "dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\r\n",
      "so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the\r\n",
      "wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble\r\n",
      "brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged\r\n",

      "England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early\r\n",
      "ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things\r\n",
      "that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they\r\n",
      "warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked\r\n",
      "her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first\r\n",
      "pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last\r\n",
      "one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and\r\n",
      "loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the\r\n",
      "lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long\r\n",
      "handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a\r\n",
      "pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would\r\n",
      "want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope\r\n",
      "ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm\r\n",

      "first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and\r\n",
      "listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all\r\n",

      "not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\r\n",
      "towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\r\n",

      "loose the dogs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we\r\n",
      "dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\r\n",
      "them. They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the\r\n",
      "robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they\r\n",
      "come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we\r\n",

      "nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said\r\n",
      "howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and\r\n",
      "then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly\r\n",
      "to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was\r\n",
      "tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the\r\n",
      "river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we\r\n",

      "He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and\r\n",
      "wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose\r\n",

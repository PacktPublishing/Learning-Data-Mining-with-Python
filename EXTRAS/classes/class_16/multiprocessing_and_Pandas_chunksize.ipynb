Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",

    "Crash course. Python multiprocessing is a separate topic and it may take time to learn it. So this is just a bried introduction with couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `pool` (like a swimming pool): allows you to do multiple jobs per process, which may make it easier to parallelize your program. If you have a million tasks to execute in parallel, you can create a Pool with a number of processes as many as CPU cores and then pass the list of the million tasks to pool.map. The pool will distribute those tasks to the worker processes(typically the same in number as available cores) and collects the return values in the form of a list and pass it to the parent process. Launching separate million processes would be much less practical (it would probably break your OS). `Pool` by itself distributes the tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `Process`: On the other hand, if you have a small number of tasks to execute in parallel, and you only need each task done once, it may be perfectly reasonable to use a separate multiprocessing.process for each task, rather than setting up a Pool.  `Process` is manually controlled\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do they compare: the Pool allocates only executing processes in memory and the `process` allocates all the tasks in memory, so when the task number is small, we can use process class and when the task number is large, we can use the pool. In the case of large tasks, if we use a process then memory problems might occur, causing system disturbance. In the case of Pool, there is overhead in creating it. Hence with small task numbers, the performance is impacted when Pool is used.\n",
    "\n",

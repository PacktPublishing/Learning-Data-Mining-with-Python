    "# Hadoop\n",
    "Apache Hadoop is a platform that got its start as a Yahoo project in 2006, which became a top-level Apache open-source project afterward. This framework handles large datasets in a distributed fashion. The Hadoop ecosystem is highly fault-tolerant and does not depend upon hardware to achieve high availability. This framework is designed with a vision to look for the failures at the application layer. It’s a general-purpose form of distributed processing that has several components: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): This stores files in a Hadoop-native format and parallelizes them across a cluster. It manages the storage of large sets of data across a Hadoop Cluster. Hadoop can handle both structured and unstructured data. \n",
    "* MapReduce: It is the algorithm that actually processes the data in parallel to combine the pieces into the desired result. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Hadoop is built in Java, and accessible through many programming languages, for writing MapReduce code, including Python, through a Thrift client.  It’s available either open-source through the Apache distribution, or through vendors such as Cloudera (the largest Hadoop vendor by size and scope), MapR, or HortonWorks. \n",

    "# Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is an open-source tool. It is a newer project, initially developed in 2012, at the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. It is focused on processing data in parallel across a cluster, but the biggest difference is that it works in memory. It is designed to use RAM for caching and processing the data. Spark performs different types of big data workloads like:\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not have its own storage system like Hadoop has, so it requires a storage platform like HDFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDD\n",
    "Spark uses Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) or Spark RDD which makes data processing faster. Also, this is the key feature of Spark that enables logical partitioning of data sets during computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "RDD stands for Resilient Distributed Dataset where each of the terms signifies its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Resilient: means it is fault tolerant by using RDD lineage graph (DAG). Hence, it makes it possible to do recomputation in case of node failure.\n",
    "    Distributed:  As datasets for Spark RDD resides in multiple nodes.\n",
    "    Dataset: records of data that you will work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Five main components of Apache Spark:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apache Spark Core: It is responsible for functions like scheduling, input and output operations, task dispatching, etc.\n",
    "* Spark SQL: This is used to gather information about structured data and how the data is processed.\n",
    "* Spark Streaming: This component enables the processing of live data streams. \n",
    "* Machine Learning Library: The goal of this component is scalability and to make machine learning more accessible.\n",
    "* GraphX: This has a set of APIs that are used for facilitating graph analytics tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1.  Fast Processing– Spark contains Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) which saves time in reading and writing operations, allowing it to run almost ten to one hundred times faster than Hadoop.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2.  Flexibility– Apache Spark supports multiple languages and allows the developers to write applications in Java, Scala, R, or Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3.  In-memory computing– Spark stores the data in the RAM of servers which allows quick access and in turn accelerates the speed of analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4.  Real-time processing– Spark is able to process real-time streaming data. Unlike Map-Reduce which processes only stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5.  Better analytics– Apache Spark consists of a rich set of SQL queries, machine learning algorithms, complex analytics, etc."

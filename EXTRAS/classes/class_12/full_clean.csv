 dear virgin customer while you re stranded in sf for days amp cost we ll do the very least we can to accommodate you 
 should use this in their next airline commercial lol 
 grouping virgin in with the others now bos weather has exposed their actual cus serv model never flight booking problems with virgin again 
 as one of the travelers affected by the boston storm m shocked at virgin complete apathy toward their customers 
 umm so no reason as to why this is is there someone different should contact or contact me to get definitive answer 
 trying to make the change in advance not just hours prior tried it online earlier and it wanted in change fees 
 so loyal that m driving to nyc from pa to fly virgin since you cut philly flights 
 any way to change from main cabin to main cabin select on same flight without paying change fee penalty 
 you guys are perfect as always lt wervirgin
 thanks all have some of the best customer service left in the industry 
 can you give me silver status for months 
 really wish you fly out of fargo those fares are amazings
 mood lighting on point reclining my seat kickin up my feet

 delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there a long line for deicing still need to improve service united
 thanks we filled it out how our luck with this is it common 
 your eri ord express connections are hugely popular now if only we could have an eri ewr hop 
 even on international flight glasgow to the s then what about orlando to newark all mins 
 you think you boarded flight au too early think so 
 understand but it tough when there is no way to get to the airport o serious risk of an accident it a steep price 
 gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights if you have way to prevent the constant issues that would rock 
 flying gla mco in few weeks how long do we have to be at airport for before departure for both international and domestic ta
 thanks
 thanks it is on the same ticket 
 why not is it law or policy 
 is the worst nonrefundable first class tickets oh because when you select global fc their system auto selects economy upgrade 
 so can buy tix days before flight but can transfer the tix flawed security logic flawed customer service
 did start claim but weeks is unrealistic am really supposed to go that long with out car seat for my child ridiculous 
 follow me please this airline is beautifull

 pls help baby hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires she needs your help pls donate rt 
 bet you wont honour them like mine ey
 nd flight also delayed no pilots but they boarded is so we can just sit here scheduling
 guess that too much ask huh 
 but it hard to stay upset at someone when they at least try to show remorse 
 by the way simple apology goes long way even if it a hollow one it obvious that you don care about me or my well being 
 this isn a one time thing either it a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect 
 fingers crossed amp its all intact very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
 it an incredibly easy fix but you would rather stay in your comfort zone while get forced out of mine 
 ours in july you have zero excuses for this you have an out of date system that causes problems like this 
 everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members they booked their tickets in october and december we bought
 not sure what you are talking about she is going on nonstop flights sna to sfo and then sfo to ewr 
 it will be because m moving to because of talk no service

 asked legitimate question about systemwide vs localized problems and got back an unrelate flightd copy paste you can do better 
 what time who can call need my skis will go to the airport and get them no more faith in united 
 see you guys are at it again amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
 tourist wonder super tides and tide of the century at french and k coasts 
 yeah sorry but there always problem with united and you have an international reputation for having problems 
 yall should probably work on that 
 but then again maybe the would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
 wonder if sharing all this on fb and insta would produce number characters really limits my story telling 
 so you re telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of negligent pilot and staff 
 could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived 
 yes please trying to get to pop in newark now 
 you have to follow me in order for me to dm come on now

 today was not your finest all could have been prevented by one gate agent advising passengers 
 what is the real deal with the delay on flight ua from denver to vegas 
 ua from madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by ua employees maryjo was rude and unhelpful 
 system failure again bad trend software projects are like flying an airplane there no such thing as an emergency takeoff

 rebooting chicago dispatch system need as m tired of sitting on planes

 tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message how can tell if it went through efz
 is flight going to sit on the tarmac forever 
 one of your workers refused to give me her name as reference for my notes her tone amp language was very unprofessional 
 that why blame your company because it had every opportunity to do job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
 wanna be grand staff
 sf crew lack lot of customer service lax employees are lot better wonder why 
 that why missed my flight if the flight had been held for minutes would have made it watched it pull away from the gate
 also didn ice the frozen metal walkway wasted minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs 
 your ground crew was inept and left truck sitting on the tarmac didn have gate agent once we got gate 
 wanna be ride united airline love airplane
 after days flight cancelled flightled another delay for hours united gave me food voucher that how much they value my time 
 checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass airlinesecurity
 what the hell flight delayed since pm finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac is this amp amp cking plane ever leaving 
 actually the flight was just cancelled flightled oc hqez
 am loyal premier platinum member but the lack of communication was really bad also don see that it has taken off yet
 thanks for having changed me managed to arrive with only hours of delay and exhausted
 this is the nd time was rebooked delays and for reasons unrelate flightd to weather how do go about requesting flight voucher 
 if you consider mins for bags pm on sunday night as fast as they can you should reconsider what you think that means 
 it the horrible attitude from staff after not just the delay not the level of service or respect one expects from united
 why do you want me to be loyal if don let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
 ua flight sfo to lax took my carry on at gate m group overhead bins are empty
 on top of that paid for st class and my wife got stuck in coach 
 ph the pat answers are bs after was denied boarding it sat at the gate until your employees totally suck 
 over the last week united has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life disgusting united
 hrs since flight landed and zero info on my missing bag rough eta would be hugely helpful restore some confidence
 big surprise nogate waiting for our plane same fucken issues everything fly you fail worstairlineever

 maybemange the airline alittlebetter arrived at lax and no gate howisthatpossible always the same thing u

 even after running to gate from your connecting flight your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked stranded
 m desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this cancelled flightled delayed flight unacceptable ord
 nope no more chances your airline messed up both ways of our trip 
 why announce it is for rollers at all if want to put coat in there isn that my choice how about all gate checked thx
 you re my early frontrunner for best airline oscars 
 bags left behind because plane overweight be great if knew as soon as we landed instead letting us wait minutes with no info 
 you are f amp king joke your customer service is woeful if your staff tell passenger that they will do something do it 
 was sponsor of the oscars no wonder it was half hour delayed oscars
 worked like charm bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim welldone goodflight friendlysky

 does asap mean two hours worth of delay and return to the terminal to count the luggage third time gottogetbetter
 apart from being on hold for over hours and having talked to people and the problem still not resolved 
 typical caned response from ua fix your crappy performing last placed ranked airline in this century 
 is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor 
 customer service is the worst hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold 
 was forced to book flight on different date than originally planned for higher price felt like bait and switch tactic
 love how you don give shit about people who tried to be loyal but you screw them every way till sunday glad ve stayed away
 tried different flight iah mnl flights are advertised for but are not bookable due to partner error 
 it will be on different airline 
 and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved 
 clicked upgrade now and it didn upgrade what gives osjz 
 you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can be book spent over hours with united support
 tried to book flight iah mnl departing returning you are advertising flights for that can be book

 going on days tomorrow and still haven received my bag from my flight to toronto would love to see some seriousness here 
 is there nothing you can do for me no compensation at all given the circumstances feel like there must be something you can do
 there is disconnect between your pr group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground liars united
 here we go again of segments sfo new york rt were delayed over hrs each why do you suck so bad maybe another line of bus

 american never had my bags apparently united never switched them over had to go back to united baggage service 
 unacceptable was min late flight for missing screw our flight to tucson left before we even landed
 cmh gate staff disaster overbooked no volunteers no boarding min late flight trying to figure out issue bringbackrealstaff
 waiting half an hour for my checked bag at ewr amp that was priority disappointing usually you guys are good 
 are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on tarmac loading bags jan
 thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in seat didn want all while not even notifying me great service 
 you guys are gay
 the emails calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the cancelled flightlation yesterday
 so they changed depart from to pm amp it is now pm amp the capt just got off the plane to find smoothie pm my ass 
 thanks so much my passport was recovered
 thanks for nothing no atlanta lounge your ap says no sure nothing at terminal k
 no thank you
 tick tock tick tock it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of pm when is the next fantasy departure time 
 it would make my day if could take flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end train your employees to communicate
 baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit what are you going to do about this 
 you cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not no empathy from gate staff or crew no apology really 
 rescheduled my return flight from japan uh why trying to call unitedairlines customerservice min wait fun
 is by far the worst airline ever 
 no re booked with american and united said they transfer our bags to them 
 am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on ewr to bos hr delays need to be explained better 
 m dming my info and no is assisting my flight home left before first flight had even landed
 boston is all self service swipe yr own boarding pass at gate most difficult tag your own bag not easy improvetheprocess
 name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check in reminder first name and mi run together cause for concern 
 more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help 
 no consistency denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing faa your website policy says otherwise time switch
only biz days calendar to respond to my inquiry hope your standards are universally adopted badcustomerservice
 thanks but why did this occur you guys had hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay so that hours you had fail 
 so many delays today what up with that hoping my pm flight boards soon united premier k
 your website is fucked up now instead of flight should ve had yesterday it today thanks 
 called back and ve been on hold what is the issue have confirmation number and an email that shows how much ve paid
 m not sure how you can help your flight experience is terrible planes are dirty and staff is rude start over perhaps 
 check in and it still saying haven paid ve called back twice was on hold for minutes then they answered and hung up i
 hold for minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set tried to
 welcome to our world that a snow world today goose bay labrador canada ki xr nk
 bought ticket yesterday and received confirmation tried to check in and they said hadn paid for it so called was on
 delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers the of just just want to fly don care about our shoes ua 
 it all about profit and they don really give damn about paying customers greed

 what did you do with my seat international connection seriously 
 thanks just got on couple of minutes ago great service on flight btw please pass it to the team on that flight 
 my bag is lost and can get ahold of anyone that can help

 your agents and service on my weekend trip have been amazing thank you 
 never flying united again worst experience ever
 ah so that where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which sat for hrs on iah runway went 
 tried that cannot figure out where to go to get it 
 cannot direct message you you do not follow us want my luggage please hep
 did you get your model 
 flight stranded on tarmac in chicago no gates available plane getting very hot and uncomfortable 
 we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait whole day to start our vacation at these fares united should have top notch service
 direct messages not going through please help
 why not charge for nd carryon instead of checked bag less jockeying for overhead space happier passengers more ontime departures
 adding reservation to ios app doesn show up on desktop site when logged in and miles can be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
 assume that would be for the other people who have been let down by united what worse is plane is here but crew can fly 
 pushing hours on hold priceless ldy a
 will do just need to get cvg and my bag too thanks
 read the thread booked st class now seated at even though united twtr account confirmed eco premium 
 hi there bag id is ua can you update me and explain why is occurred when arrived hours before flight 
 doesn purchasing ticket with united card give me priority boarding 
 hi yes need free hotel stay in honalulu due to hour delayua since we will miss our second flight to kauai
 so what the solution 
 is screwing with my flights again at cae why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get cancelled flighted 
 no need you to have more than agents at check in 
 so this did not work out at all incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over twitter 
 we got it thanks 
 the so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from houston to norway shoulder shrugging is all you do 
 this is probably the least dependable airline in the western hemisphere does not belong in star alliance but skyteam
 severely under staffed at iah 
 amazing hospitality and helpfulness from anthony lastella great staff def flying united again 
 this hr delay is vacation buzzkill
 just touched down in miami not too far off nicely done united

 same day flights
 it is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting voucher by telling them you have availability on late flightr
 give me direct number can call regarding my lost baggage immediately 
 involuntarily bumped your passenger and can guarantee them another flight for three days 
 please follow faa guidelines regarding bumping it is not acceptable to give voucher for an fare when you ve
 did already rebook and now will miss my first appointments in london tomorrow morning thanks for ruining my trip again 
 our newest delay right now ftlzwtvo
 if you show available seats you need to honor that shouldnt spend hr on phone to hear that really there are not seats

 you ve got to be kidding me still haven talked to human and your robotweeting me and asking for follow 
 wouldn describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience to help you might find my baggage you lost amp return it 
 and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
 is that all that matters not the fact that we re at different destination we were put through tremendous amount of stress 
 member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag gee thnx ua awesome job
 absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers isn there anyone actively monitoring your cust serve this is unreal 
 nice wonder how you pick who to respond to maybe only happy customers are easier wonder how many of those you have left

 you can read the full story when submit case to your team about the pilot of flight and why we are sleeping in dia
 what with the layover in canada from the ua is that scheduled

 sloppy stuff you don see anymore united has raised my expectations this team was poor
 how long does it take to get response from your customer service about complaint done through email 
 no bag tagging led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
 cabin crew were huge offenders stood as conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
 allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
 no wheelchairs
 no commitment to good turnaround an operations mgr would have counted dozen small issues with individual performance
 the nightmare continues f
 this team added mins on turnaround
 as million miler with ua and flying almost every week observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations
 call wait times are over minutes and airport wait times are longer
 thanks we did

 thank you for compensating us for our lost bags we will fly with you again unitedairlines

 so going forward shouldn be flight booking problems star alliance flights through the united app 
 have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time

 dm sent this lack if customer service is getting ridiculous

 my wife has been on the phone several times for past days with no result 
 so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone their response is humiliating for company that serves the public 
 unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit not for you to correct your atrocious customer service good to know
 unitedairlines fill out form and never receive response expect remedy we can travel another airline and cancelled flight as members u 
 ewr lax ua my seat armrest broken discover after takeoff flight full fa filed report who to chat with for partial refund 
 so you told me to go knowing what the issue was only for me to go there and find out that you won fix it 
 so made it all the way to the airport and they say they won fix the handle showed you this problem and you said to go 
 this link in your tweet goes to someone internal email gt itdn probably one of your rd party it contracts

 ooh thanks 
 my flight was at pm still at the airport gee what service do they care nope delayed until 
 very disappointed in cc purchased ticket online voucher and charge full amnt would not hold price after refund unacceptable
 exactly it states secure document is nexus card it does not state passport must always be also presented read it
 we were told by united to carry over carry back for the refund 
 no had to leave for work would have not been possible so would love to have this replaced now
i feel completely cheated read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there 
 of your agents said we would be refunded agents said united should never have sold us the ticket 
 if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
 it problems with the link thparty
 feel very well informed yes the flight is indeed delayed thank you 
 why do pay more for coach plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
 can get some help changing ticket minutes on hold and counting 
 thanks for all the help totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
 was told by supervisor that united disconnected their customer support so there was nobody to address it now igiveup
 your mileageplus signup page is broken 
 for wifi just so can tell my family m gonna be late flight cause had to sit in grounded plane for the past two hours 
 fyi continuous texts and emails am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful

 also why can i pre select seats on sfo gt yyz flight m canadian flight booking problems on lv 
 does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare amp seats 
 thanks 
hypocrisy rt m sorry we re not able to offer full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for kp
 shouldn have to spend my own on hotel because of weather delay the weather being something completely out of my control
 eventually you should approach bags like they get it 
 what if my nyc flight is delayed and miss my connection to sacramento from chicago 
 said they would give us refund days late flightr no refund 
 how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for hrs not convinced your company is safe for flt 
 we showed up to our flight several hours early tried to call amp was on hold min f call disconnected 
 if your policy changed you must advise at the time of purchase same if you choose to vary it by airport we want full refund 
 wanted to but you cancelled flightled my tickets they were too special guess even for united 
 m for flight booking problems without major problems isn bad 
 don check your baggage if you don have to they will lose it 
 m hoping we don miss our lax ito connection not looking forward to being stuck at lax overnight with our team again 
 well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated we travel between canada amp usa on united with only nexus
 how can you not know after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded the planes weight 
 you make it hard to fly with you delayed over an hour and now the plane is turning around amp heading back to the gate connection 
 serious firing needs to happen at hnl they broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine kyrbyj
 call customer service and of course they just say theres nothing we can do and then offer transfer and disconnect the line 
 now submitted for the third time please check and confirm receipt have taken screen shots in case it disappears again thanks
 if our already rescheduled flight is cancelled flightled is our hotel room paid for 
 classic
 elizabeth at washington dulles just hooked me up with new connecting flight at my gate m super pleased 
 thanks 
 does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as premium cabin 
 flight ua been sitting on tarmac for mins with no report as to why any input 
 rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off excellent service united is offering 
 no thanks
 yesterday m sorted now 
 thanks for that advice so helpful can believe you guys actually charge people to fly united
 if you have had any issues with united airlines please retweet paid for full fight ticket and was given standby instead 
 just tried to log in and was told mail log in not currently available
 so why did you cancelled flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn like the exchange rate doublestandards
 do you have an mail address can write my account to might be less likely to disappear
 so wasted mins filling in online forms you are telling me you didn receive how do know this won happen this time 
 from amsterdam to ewr 
 stuck here in iah waiting on flight to honolulu for hours due to maintenance issues could we have gotten new plane fail
 what kind of hypocrisy is that only cancelled flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage united
 no the entire problem here is that was never sent anything via email and only given flight booking problems number over the phone 
 calling that number was useless heading to the airport now to pick up my bags this whole situation seems like real joke 
 they couldn get me first class on any of their flights so just rebooked myself 
 but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster travelingwithsmallkids
 ll be sending posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter united airlines should be ashamed 
 hidden city forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg your support cannot fix

 with karen and found her unhelpful and rude called united at the time amp told she could board but karen would not accept
 she has crossed prior times with other carriers and no issue karen was rude untrained and unhelpful also spoke
 nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air car or boat she can travel with only nexus 
 employee yelled at her employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
 refused boarding with nexus nexus confirmed she should not be refused
 on good note the employees encountered newark were fabulous was very late flight for my connecting flight and they got me on 
 lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee does that make sense to you and yes already called cust svc they said no

 am thankful to the united ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out home late flight is still home 
 appreciate the follow up 
 that the gist of what the flight attendant told her 
 btw is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation 
 what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger shoulders 
 no but cld explain how such disorganized and inefficient company surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business 
 sat at airport for hrs still sitting at gate sigh
 actually we did not consider she might have made mistake she did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation

 super smooth flight and landing nicely done 
 try harder take winners attitude to your work 
 you can do better than this and you can do better for me and all the passengers flight jfk to pwm 
 we would have been up in the air by now now our new plane we ve been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 
 you delay all my flights then you redirect my gate then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 
 our fleet on fleek m this happened
 definitely no note from whoever stole from me 
 but the hour policy when called and they said didn report it soon enough what would have changed if had noticed sooner 
 hopefully that will help someone in the future would there have been different procedure if had discovered the theft sooner 
 did that as soon as realized will they try to figure out who is stealing from people bags security cameras anything 
 did but since was stranded in syr without ride missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter hours 
 absolutely no worries m just never flying with you again ever even have to hitch hike cross country passengersarepeople

 wish you all the best of luck m enjoying the luxurious free amount of leg space rn thanks

 what is the deal with flt today departure keeps changing when is it going why is it so late flight 
 lol at your estimated departure time plane hasn even started boarding yet you can even get your delays right 
 you know how love you jb but honestly when you have complex feedback those pull down sub option forms maddening 
 said they haven started looking for it gave me limit in nyc at the waldorf astoria and can find outfit 
 how can best track deals and special flight offers m liking your international options 
 yeah m aware of that hence my original msg to you 
 just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal airline is disaster 
 no asked either way it doesn make the flight less delayed 
 from orlando to dca and my awesome flight attendant is robert 
 yes filed yesterday around noon have claim number but they haven contacted me yet 
 shocker my flight delayed an hour thanks for reminding me why switched to delta 
 as courtesy to mosaic members or anyone request for water should be attended promptly daniel in flight should know better
 are you having any issues with online check in my colleague and are getting webpage not available after submitting online form
 no one yet but some fl 
 are going to let fl into gate in bos any time soon we re just sittin here on the tarmac waiting 
 thanks jb actually as birder love them too they just need to be outside it shouldn be too hard to trap and move them 
 not an issue but think training amp information would help great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
 rats that a bummer 
 is so sloooooow today
happy for sfo but hopefully you ll add pdx soon we added two new destinations fll and sfo from las vegas in the last year 
 flight from jfk sfo was pure awesomeness mint class and tim our attendant was the best other airlines take notes 
 terrible landing on

 wall separating in row safetyconcerns l
 last sleep in cali back to jfk tomorrow night looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all 
 woo update flight is now possibly delayed by more than hrs power of positive thinking people 
 appreciate the response but already spoke to mco and their response was there is nothing we can do idk if that what you mean
 with the free wifi impressive flyfi rypzebc 
 didn find out my flight for ny scheduled to leave at pm is delayed by more than hrs until after checking in huge fail 
 vegas desk said jfk connect would held us and others on our plane now staff at jfk says weather was problem epicfail
 other jfk to boston flights went off with some delay but not this epicfail
 understand delays we are all looking at tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow hence delay 
 mint seats are awesome best business class in the us 
 wtf stuck at jfk for hrs in delay to boston cuz say snow no snow on weather map wtf 
 thank you for getting me home and despite all odds have reunited with my delinquent southwest luggage now homeward
 words staff training what joke 
 is joke missed my connecting flight by minutes last flight of the day and they don hold it minutes 
 sorry should have specified meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal
 any idea what going on at terminal five at jfk seems to be zero traffic movement
 very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept nearly had to beg get just for courtesy report 
 ok thanks safety first 
 apparently the plane was delayed coming up from san juan monsoon there today 
 that ok it just sure seemed like it when jetblue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching haha
 over hour delay going from nyc to denver come on man 
 no oscars on direct tv on this flight we were so looking forward to it we were devastated 
 fix your amp jet bridges minute delay nd gate still waiting jetblues oncs i
kudos well deserved just wish the rest of my experience today measured up to their example 
 ha ha can get wake up call at boarding time please large coffee extralight extra sweet please 
 didn work fly fi plus couldn access abc app so spent and still missed oscars disappointed
 think ll come take nap at the terminal 
 safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not 
 pretty sure he saying ricoh had great service down at bos happytohelp
 from jfk to las still delayed 
 the lack of tv made it rough that literally why picked all over the competitors 
 but not reddit work for the site and this is ridiculous 
 thank you am your new big fan

 pilot don worry folks there a backup for the backup for every part of this plane thanks guy
 can you take off your blacklist trying to work 
 goodwill now at fine still want your new ceo to make public apology to all passengers of flight 
 thank you hopefully it soon we are supposed to leave at 
 thank you 
 awesome
 okay so anything using contactless emv should work just your internal testing and training is currently apple pay specific 
 hard when you re with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane we should get better than this
 had potentially stressful situation in reflight booking problems flight which she diffused and helped make awesome 
 even tho the extra lbs are still going on the plane just as carry on where is the sense what do you say to fat people 
 thought being mosaic member had perks the best part is instead of checking the extra lbs m carrying it on 
 are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days you went from to for overweight fees outrageous
 if only the show was on the flight no abc oh well ll live nexttime andthewinneris 
 ill call in the morning too upset right now 
 im still waiting no answer 
 ok thanks for your help 
 love you guys nruovts
 the amount of money spent on hotels for week bc of flight cancelled flightlation another flight doesn make up for the money lost 
 being told jfk had hour delay this am which is reason for my delay now it can be that hard to notify with hours notice
 by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk 
keep waiting time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback pg gom 
 you re still the best
 please give jetblue all the permissions in the world m missing the oscars right now and it awful whyabcwhy
 thanks so the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather relate flightd problems 
 ll be checking often most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds geeks and badly dressed 
 am less concerned about the delay than am about not being notified until looked at the board that my flight was delayed
 thanks made it 
 after boarding flight the captain informs that he could exceed the hrs regulation and turned the plane around incredible 
 thanks for the quick response fingers crossed the plane gets here then
 considering accessibility is an absolute must equality
 how do we watch the oscars though right now no abc on flight missingtheoscars
 thank you fingers crossed 
 ooookay that silly of you guess we re watching the oscars purely on twitter reactions tonight oscars
 ve heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept only apple pay thought that was impossible amp certainly not emv compliant
 you re taking me to new orleans in two weeks so ll picture that while shiver forevercold
 we re flight ffl to lga scheduled departure 
 nd time in row flight out of jfk disaster last time wasn allowed to fly stndby now hour delay out notification
 oh right me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in sdq gb hgw t
 bunch of flights are delayed from ffl to northeast destinations no announcements at the gate what going on 
 m dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight in santo domingo have been treated hrs to board the plane and no info given
 id appreciate that would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that be allowed to announce over intercom 
 if you want we can keep you updated on who wearing who amp who with who amp who wins what we re nice like that 
 did they have no idea where it is 
 thanks but still annoying especially if miss my flight can tweet at the tsa 
 hey jetblue still waiting to hear where you lost my surfboard between jfk and bqn airports 
 your gif game is strong 
 well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility jacpmch
 flight den to jfk already hrs delayed any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc 
 why close prechk at pm on sunday at jfk annoying
 your crew didn say it was about safety if they say that was glad to stay check the information you give to the costumers
 you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in south florida bc of your disorganization getittogether
 m going to write post on about the experience your customer service has tanked jetblue
 still no response from ceo guess he is at the oscars bet his flight was on time justwrong
 okay names of sj crew are alamo tatiana keep telling me to hold then leave desk ali told me he couldn help bc going on break
 aha ok thanks was worried there might not be seat at all will do it at the airport tomorrow then 
 that is stock response delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv amp being told by ppl to wait amp they come back but did not 
 ricoh smith at bos provided oust and service
 hr delay on flight to jfk via tampa amp worst customer service in san juan airport this after app not working all day 
 just please get my luggage from onto carousel logan airport and ll be able to go home 
 what happens when have confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for even more space upgrades 
 thanks for the response just been waiting for hours and really frustrated seems like no one at jetblue is concerned 
 tx for the info just don understand why you couldn accurately estimate departure time earlier weather in ny is fine now 
 hey me and my family have questions on trip to disney world that we are doing in april please follow me so could dm you guys
 so glad to hear thanks for sharing the video me and jetblue are bff 
 no good just get me home
 thanks for the response we are hopeful 
 update please on why flight continues to be further delayed
 ok tx will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate
 thank you for not even coming with solution great service might say as trueblue member am totally dissatisfied thanks
 all day
 how about free wifi on flt out of pbi to make up for hr delay treat us right 
 why is flight delayed out to ny same problem 
 is that guarantee we ll see about that tomorrow morning when have to fight for seat 
 thanks for the update preciate it hope it gets here been delayed days getting back
 yes they are working on it hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home 
 well my paid tickets have no assigned seats at all so essentially won be on this flight unless pay more 
 if seats aren guaranteed why do we pay for them when called the rep said some other people booked our seats 
 thank you for the refund of the change fee for recent flight affected by our bizarre winter excellent customer service and focus
 yes please get me the seats we paid for 
 flight departs am finally arrived jfk with no psgrs at pm that a long flight aka bus ztgi
 thanks for help can wait to travel with and get out of the snow 
 help left my nikon camera under the seat in front of me what do do 
 hope your customer service reps are as reliable friendly as they usually are so far you are not living up to your rep exper 
 the man with the smell left nd now there this stupid girl asking me questions can yall help 
fyi the last email response we undrstnd this wasnt best you but hope wlcm back onbrd the future nice touch lol
 think have it selected already 
 last flight was cancelled flightled then it was hours to change light bulb now sitting here waiting for maintenance unreal 
 thanks for answering my questions 
 that wasn delayed or cabcelled
 have to say that jetblue has officially lost customer what waste of all the points have too am yet to be in flight 
 will keep on tweeting until your ceo answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight just wrong 
 think it safe to say that after years of loyal jetblue flying we are officially done byebyejetblue
 have someone driving me it best to get wheelchair once get inside 
 finally finally 
 token goodwill voucher for passengers stuck on flight from phoenix today hour mark how about per passenger
 anything serious should worry about 
 cool are there stairs at jfk can walk short distances but not stairs 
 think about it boarding to chill untz untz untz like this larive 
 why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you jetbluefail sb rbicx
 seriously what is your solution who exactly will help my year old if there a problem with the plane a
 your scheduling skills failed the delay went from four hours to nearly six don tell me you were snowbound in pbi 
 the man sitting next me at the terminal has scent tht cant quite put my finger on pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight 
 sadly no have the app but it also is experiencing difficulties the flight information boards are keeping me updated

 you re lucky we re still flying you after today landing gear failure get your act together and help us sit with our kids 
 so the prefference option is not something that you honor so why having it as one of the services if not applied 
 if you want to be helpful find us seat don quote terms and conditions jetbluefail
 do you really think it okay to sit kids away from parents srsly esp after your landing gear failure syw mdvu
 they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids your terms response is insulting jetblue
 flight jfk to tpa am on saturday one way ticket 
 what your excuse this time for delay from lga to tpa know the plane is in the air 
 if you can guarantee parents will sit with their children don sell tickets with that promise jetblue nz 
 once you go blue you don go back
 why are there so many delays to north east cities 
 kids fly don hire people who don care about them this guy jetblue 
 shouldn be made to feel like criminal because want to sit near my year old on flight jetblue u
 usually have such great experience with you guys very very unhappy with you right now 
 why would you hire guy who doesn care about the safety of children not remotely acceptable hyhw 
 what up three delays so far resulting in over three hours of unnecessary extra waiting 
 for the record that was less than minute turnaround time for the answer from the question jetblue rocks 
 never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids but this guy is willing to do it jetblue 
 from san diego with hour delay to jfk even you have amex jetblue even having over travel miles you re still nothing
 it seems almost inconceivable that sitting year old alone is considered okay but this guy thinks so nzyspk
 third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys this will be my last trip with you 
 you ve let me down delay at jfk because of inbound flight from syracuse really ishouldhavedriven
 year old can sit alone on flight this is absurd and this guy is dick jetblue hxsdp ha 
 being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our and year old on the flight jetblue flbgzzkd
 of my tray table is broken what do do 
 domestic to be clear do not have to sit in your lovely terminal just need to be there hour prior to boarding thanks

 flight from bos rsw tomorrow all need is my wife yr old to sit together but no option when checking in 
 is your partnership with hawaiian live earn hawaiian miles flying jetblue if so how do add to my jb flight booking problems 
 you left people on hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and half and then had to bus them to jfk because of 
 at what point in delays can take different flight to my destination 
 thank you guys you are the best 
 you just don get it it not about the money it about people how about public apology from the president of jet blue 
 why when you book flight now does jetblue separate yr old from the mother isn that bit stupid check in headaches 
 does not fit in 
 love it as always 
 you never got my wife to her destination and you expect goodwill credit will make everything hunky dory you blew it 
 every time look at the flight status more minutes is added to the delay how about some points for trouble

 if that was the case why did your alert arrive so late flight four hour delay don buy it

 want to add my flight to mexico was on air canada same exact situation but with none of the problems ve had with jet blue 
 you mean take more of my time to write you physical letter because the fraud department doesn have email or telephones right

 thanks

 repping the bruins in cleveland at rock roll hof amp the christmas story house jetbluebruins 
 no it didn all work out called jet blue from mexico to address the fraud alert with capital one on the line rebooked 
 actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved but why then did they issue me new ticket of the phone 
 called jet blue to get an explanation and make sure it would not happen in the future was told to write the fraud dept 
 we made it safe and sound thank you for the safe travels 
 when arrived at the airport was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had fraud alert 
 my card company and explained the issue over the phone when was in mexico purchased new ticket over the phone 
 but jet blue had cancelled flighted my ticket amp never reissued it 
 my credit card company accidentally marked my jet blue tickets as fraud then corrected their mistake and reposted the money

 hi m in lga but my luggage is in clt have been told to come back tomorrow to collect do you guys want to cover my taxi fare 
 instead of fair treatment got nasty letter from lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death 
 few years ago lost over miles bc was physically unable to fly during the period submitted doctor note 
 ve never been treated this badly
 m glad this airline is going to be swallowed by american american always picks up the phone and solves problems 
 three months and my miles haven been credited no one is going to read the email sent 
 my email gets me canned response that it takes days for mileage to get credited it been three months and my miles
 my tweet gets me response to email dmsc com
 the help complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
 no one picks up the phone all day no opportunity to leave voicemail
 instead the miles are credited to an account that did not open my request to merge the accounts is denied
 no was there hrs early send me an email to share my experience you don want this blasting here 
 open the credit card and earn miles and you wont credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
 you took the miles out of my account and told me that could restore by paying or opening credit card
 had miles in my account and was informed d forfeit them bc of months of inactivity i
 it all automated and no one cares to understand the problem m having
 screwed me up big st flight hr late flight made it to nd flight csm daryl wouldn let me on the plane because we were 
 houston hub aa employee the bag is not here it made it to pa before me oops not your problem hwfkfo
 charged my card times for one airline ticket now card is on security hold

 ve flown us airways at least five times every single time has been like this actions speak louder than words 
 flight from bhm delayed hrs connect flgt left us in clt at motel

 honestly how is it quickly as possible ve been on hold sine pm everyone that answers has to send me to someone else 
 done it process initiated saturday morning can get info with website issues amp inadequate phone coverage how get update 
 yay for glitchy tracking system my bags made it to my destination and not laguardia like the app said 
 really not one of them can book dividend miles travel literally on hold now since pm it pm noexcuses
 yeah know that but that doesn get me my money back does it everytime fly with you something bad happens 
by the grace of god made it we don have those powers in here we hope you can make that flight 
 everyone is sorry don have what need for meeting tomorrow charac isn nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
 is the worst have to pay just to not take my first flight in round trip otherwise they ll cancelled flight my whole flight 
 if it was so important why did wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer disappointed
 thank i wiil write after call travel agency
 terrible service
 disgusted with your poor customer service wrongfully remove gt miles from my dividend miles and no live person 
 please hold flight us in phoenix m weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues 
 no live person to speak with all day at dividend miles after they wrongfully took over miles out of my account 
 my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences late flightly currently lost luggage want to talk to real person 
 cust svc means nothing so disappointed trying since to speak to human get bad weather not bad service socialtantrum

 very embarrassing 
 m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for flight attendant who isn up on current policy to argue with traveler 
 yes know the industry procedure on baggage thanks for helping what about the impossible connection that started this 
 agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding amp we all sat in the plane for almost hrs
 and despite tailwind will still be late flight 
 characters are not enough to convey the issue was directed to emailmailto customer relations com unmonitored bad
 thanks sent you dm re baggage issues 
 have and you have not been able to locate them its insane trust you and pay you to look after my things and you lost them 
 and yet the flight attendant argued with me over exec plat benefits

 horrible travel day your airlines my flight to birmingham was cancelled flightled no notification so couldn get on the 
 asked if that was sop and they said it is now but yet the other flights nothing is this policy or not 
 while m asking of my non upgraded flights attendants came amp greeted me amp thanked me for my business c was exec plat 
 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes back home to the us hr layover and get to watch it going to wrong destination 
 it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink snack detailed here za xb amp being argued with

 flt hrs late flight baggage more hr now see they delivered my suitcase wet inside amp out nothappy
 then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight 
 so she has to take late flightr flight booked by her corporate disney travel dept as your agent offered little help
 your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
 as the employee responsible for social media content yes probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
 flight gets in minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren here minutes late flightr

 you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest at least they treat their customers properly

 and by the way m planning it while ve ben waiting in the line at customer service in phx for over an hour 
 already planning my local boycott for washington c area 
 can legitimately say that would have rather driven cross country than flown on us airways 
 and despite the fact see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me

 hey guys thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at pm pst

 big thanks to yvonne anthony from the chairman desk top tier customer service today outstanding service amp support 
 now the plane is degrees and we are burning up this is completely illegal 
 are you fucking kidding me 
 now siting on tarmac in philly for another minutes this is so lame sorry doesn help this is terrible 
 what is the damn delay 
 it would be nice to just pull up to the gate still sitting here
 app is the worst one for airlines can do anything once your original flight time has gone by useless 
 has completely wasted my work day thank you for the bad service and bad friday 
 and also it great that you tweet complainers but what about the in person help when need it robyn in manch useless 
 you ll be receiving long amp detailed complaint letter soon long story short never flying usair again 
 thanks for making miss connection getting rebooked missing that too and miserable day started my day am for nothing 
 need to learn operations sit plane overnight at gsp and not realize there a mech problem then delay flight hours 
 that the flight was delayed amp closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and half bad bad service
 why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and half when you knew at the gate
 he overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled you should refund me had no choice grossedout
 appreciate your prompt response 
 nothing was available male flight crew was not nice dismissive big guy was standby and probably didn even pay for choice
 well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on 
 did not want to hang out on your plane all day when am traveling to get work done and turn right back around unacceptable
 doesn seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in lax and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn help usairwaysfail
 this is complete waste of my day trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day ridiculous
 we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for time longer than our actually flight 
 the plane is moving and it no ice we are moving to the end of the runway to sit because lga has one runway open 
 of course weather was joke beats degrees in phl 
 nothing was available male flight crew was not nice dismissive big guy was standby and probably didn even pay 
 is setting themselves up for lawsuit no way we should sit on plane for an hour and half 
 thks us phl to fll overall st class has improved with more food now on phl to fll and most crews are super 
 want to not sit on plane from dca to lga for an hour and half which is longer than my flight 
 this is so unacceptable m going for the day now most of my day will be sitting on your plane not to mention there is no air
 is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and half they didn even let us off 
 hi is there somebody avail who can help with an refund its unbelievable on the phone us for more than hrs in days

 thanks for taking my flight off the board and not providing and updates about my flight which is minutes late flight 
 am so going to miss us airways you always provided great service and never let me down 
 never again worse experience in my life ddqq gqni
 rebooked myself but cancelled flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable you started delaying at pm 
 hrs stranded in dca zero apologies and the worst customer service been faithful traveler for years but no more 
 this response doesn correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
 been at dca at pm still here at am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane absolutely worse experience 
 it was almost hours late flight due to mechanical 
 never flying usairways again horrible experience terrible customer service 
 mobile boarding pass email 
 we will sunday just few days away
 am following you now
 unacceptable you knew the pilot wouldn be able to complete the trip wasted all of our time 
 have been on three planes for flight and still haven left the ground bad service sad
 then told to offload because the captain was over hours this has been terrible experience 
 why were we loaded onto the plane hours late flight mind you made to sit for minutes
 why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period unacceptable 
 offloading the plane this is ridiculous 
 we re excited to have you fly with us jb when will this be spring break 
 still just sitting here nobody has said anything what up 
 that is actually not true you can get seat online after big hassle that policy is totally dishonest and misleading faa
 will thank you for at least tweeting me back better than most 
 that seems unlikely without crew here to board us
 that incorrect four people last flight of the night with our bags horriblecustomerservice
 exicted to be flying with all soon 
 and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking buttons 
 the fact that you are making customers pay to choose seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors
 ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than 
 your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide shameonyou usairwayssucks
 worst experience ever with you guys see my blog tomorrow on my experience maybe you can help make it better 
 now the freezing bus is just doing circles 
 please explain have plenty of time since m stranded 
 doubt that its amp we still being held captive on the ground at dca little communication from up front would nice 
 why does it cost to change ticket when it only cost to purchase new ticket 
 sitting on freezing bus because nobody is in the plane what is up 
 we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary 
 doesn want me to get home
 they don stand alone for me bought tix based on usair confirmed flight what good is confirmation if you change it anyway 
 dca gt hpn r prof hostage takers we stood on bus plane for min now sitting on plane with no mvmt amp announcement gt hour 
 bet you don but m the paying customer here know how to check for flight delays thank you 
 can even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive forcing me to purchase new ticket 
 oh great after hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving flight has been awful
 that the st sorry received from your company the least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge 
 never flying with you guys again extremely disorganized and too many delays 
 my buddies are currently delayed hours and counting in dca on their ways to cae for golf week any compensation flydelta
 flights was the delay flight was my missed connection help 
 the flight that did not connect to was 
 even when do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won be that difficult am sure disappointed
 yes not sure how you guys don know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
 wow your miles program is ripoff quick ticket fee hope you all end up on unemployment 
 bos gt dca delayed again this needs to stop will be filing complaints with the faa and consumer affairs
 sitting on the tarmac waiting to deplane minutes the level of service ve come to expect 
 you gladly take the loyal customer money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused 
 the least you could do is make up for what you have caused you are ruining people memories you should be ashamed 
 st late flight plane then missing flight crew then maintenance problems gates switched times you call this customer service 
 due to your expensive change fees either out of all the airlines we chose yours all do you could screw us stranded no help 
 we can afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home turns out we can afford to go home 
 but it not their fault because their policy says they at least got us to our destination really 
 ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight and now we are stranded

 thanks if you have another method also that would be nice appears to be design flaw
 yes every one of these on every flight is like this there needs to be more velcro or something
 please secure the footrest shelf in business class on airplanes bvexmcj
 forgetting to fuel up realizing there was more cargo to add to plane one way to try and mask delay 
 your gate team are polite but your planes are habitually late flight in many cases passengers are waiting for the flight crew

 if passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat what is my recourse nothappy
 so was just told was coded as an upgrade clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade ripoff
 the gate agent said it booked in full sorry had ticket with st class seat will call customer service when land 
 empty st class chairman can move up due silly award travel rule trumping common sense customer service fail again 
 can they change to correct last name did via reservations already but said can change ticket name 
 you re the only airline that not open sooner it not confidence booster 
 checked in last night airport by supervisor boarding pass for boarding today seat changed to how does that happen 
 new problem had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed new can get through tsa
 cardholder is flying we both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating 
 received brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged baggage included
 if paid for ticket with advantage world executive card do pay baggage fees when flying us airways wife traveling now
 this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
 testing my patience this evening or shall say morning we waited an hour at the gate for you to find gate agent am
 flying from manchester international to philadelphia and getting emails about delays no information about connecting flights 
 thank you to cincy just landed you should add frequent flyer miles to my account long incredibly frustrating day
 no other than being on my credit card statement have not received anything from you and so have no way to look it up myself
 waited on hold for too long shouldn have to wait on hold forever when never received confirm in the st place help
 been dealing to solve the probs your team created your manch nh staff is clearly your team btw notevenjv

 was told my ticket expired but never recvd any notice before it expired this sucks paid miles amp for the tckt

 sitting for minutes on the runway at dca because your gates are full early landing late flight flight

 delays to the max
 on sunday can wait see you then
 well this is nofun nocustomerservice onhold trying to make reservations nothappy mmq fa
 it shouldn take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes minutes flying time minutes on runway so far
 attempting ckin for flight on all day site unable to retrieve details called twice and disconnected 
 emailed them week ago and still nothing 
 would be willing to pay anything to change flight does not help 
 yeah you guys just told me to call the website that booked from booked on your website unacceptable
 still waiting captain reports he called times to get ground crew and still sitting on runway evenlate flightr

 you have most likely lost my business terrible experience too many times stuck on tarmac and last min cancelled flightled flights done
 have been doing that all day can find my bag anywhere bc they re saying it was never scanned amp technically never left lax

 tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in que for over mins please hold we don care

 how does that help me when get no response from there usairwayssucks
 team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged not happy blizzard
 surprisingly quick response time by you and them thanks 
 stop cancelled flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers strandedinnashville
 strikes again lost bags and two of them theworst
 had cancelled flight my trip to la bc weather was easy but us air is making me pay to use the credit never again
 what the point of baggage claim ticket if they don scan it for tracking 
 no access to dividend miles and for week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back late flightr frustrated livepersonplease
 you can even track my bag to see where it is it like it disappeared 
 can get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles it been over month since travel amp ve submitted twice online
 been sitting on this plane for minutes and they are saying another minutes something about paper work this sucks 
 is there gonna be better day to call ve called on separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to person 
 spent more on the room amp transportation then did the whole flight
 ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that had to spend
 asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
 only to come home day late flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
 doubt it gate is cluster and every agent encounter saw including one with me was outright rude just very put off 
 have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get free room and transportation to and from the airport
 the voucher you give us for hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do 
 so mad can even believe you guys cancelled flight my connecting flight after leave the first stop amp give me useless hotel voucher
 priorities should have been made considering pending snow storm why delay flight for an hour amp half d like an answer 
 experienced what defines customer service on flt flight attendant willing to follow up with passenger on bag charges
 ve done everything still no luck in finding my bag don understand how my bag could have been misplaced very upsetting 
 that wasn my but thanks wondering why you re the only ones disguised yours to not call you out uwuosc 
 turns into with such difficulty to past loyal customer as aa platinum flyer usair couldn be more unhelpful why
yes but will nvr fly i missed my con flight bc of coffeemaker on ft couldn see my father be they put him in coma
 minutes to put my tsa number in mins and stop holding people hostage with requiring dividends miles acct 
 so would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone usairwayssucks
 really so what does that mean usairwayssucks
 thanks can you help remind the agents it ok ps heard rumors of streaming wifi tv movie service you might be installing
 nope done was supposed to get home at pm and didn get home until midnight neveragain
 the only way to assist is to actually answer the phone 
 would it kill you to give me seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold 
 would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation 
 would it kill you to not let miles expire
 would it kill you to let me know how many minutes might be on hold 
 totaled not happy not at all 
 have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply usairwaysssuck
 the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on stationary plane for hours is don really know what happened 
 thanks 
 my number is cant wait lol usairsucks
 have him call me cant wait to see if anything happens your service really sucks usairwayssucks
 she also appreciated having her very own hashtag lucycat
 we hate delays have you tried any of these stktjxan although we re not sure what timbit is 
 big fail on not having curbside baggage in pittsburgh and you charge dollars bag 
 is it possible to earn dividend miles for passenger that is not me even if am purchasing the tickets 
 hope so too thank you for your help she traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase 
 would you consider honoring the original fare price if were to try flight booking problems the ticket again 
 booked an award ticket recently now same ticket is less miles how do contact you without using the online form or phone 
 you are the best follow me please 
 would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible

 followed you complaint procedure only to get run around your service sucks usairwayssuck
 don mind waiting mind waiting on plane when shouldn have had to the airport has more room and you know food 
 that is appreciated however the system tells you call back late flightr then ends the call no need to reply thanks 
 why would you board ppl on plane its their turn to de ice why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process 
 tried that before using twitter also gave me no helpful information thank you anyway
 am sure you are sincere in your apology its disappointing from customer perspective when you want loyal customers options
 yeah know that but now ll have to spend almost dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
 yeah either by refunding my money or free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through 
 are you an incompetent airline every day or just days that end in 
 there isn a ticket number the transaction is still pending 
 do families no longer get early boarding with young kids american your new parent gives it to us 
 not patient originally and now 
 your agent did not say
 no they could be at laguardia jfk or charlotte have no idea where they are now tho
 they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not what airline serves food anymore update in policy 
 it is the nd person when called again to ask could not catch her name rejected the request

 that link leads to website that won open on cell phone good job shocking that your airline is folding 
 my flight us got cancelled flightled on due to lack of flight crew was told that d be reimbursed for hotel who do contact

 d like to apologize to the gate agent for flight aa was not aware that zone was after the nine other precious gems 
 my key point of confusion is whether can make this change even though the initial flight booking problems was on us airways metal 
 origin destination dates are the same going from us airways connecting flight to aa direct flight award is saver level 
 when will the old fly ord pvg get upgraded

 lost my basket ballbag on your plane
 thanks for the great customer service family made it back to sat safely the weather at dfw made things little worrisome 
 she seems little preoccupied that why m bringing it to your attention am just flagging an issue as an observer 
 she was at gate on time though they made her cry and made scene for mins instead of boarding her plane still outside 
 disappointing lack of kindness toward this person the agent asked her counterparts why this person was talking to her 
 yes starting flight getting me home more than hours late flightr record locator bsuxlu

 good morning wondering why my pre tsa check was not on my boarding pass this morning

 oh will aa on speed dial
thanks was just about to book flight to uk using but after reading this exchange there no way ve sent
 amazing to watch who travels with celebs all over the world show the youth of america who not to fly with 
 travel week delays cancelled flightlations if you want to learn more about the merger press delay my connector in chicago deice
 requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction 
 horrible service luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude didn help at all 
 that a rather clunky process whoever designed that clearly doesn understand mail 
 thanks flight today great crew 
 thank you for contacting american the email address you have written to is an unmonitored account 
 your customer relations dept has one way mail how is not allowing responses helpful 
 if you are sorry answer my claims aa ref and accordingly without using weather 
 the motor that usually starts the engine is broke and ground crew failed to do it on time per pilot maintenance
 is rising like the sun at dca this morning members have the best view avgeek 
 she has the guy served drinks til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is more important then the assaulted women
 there a lot of talks and no doing mia sfo on year old plane nonewplanes old shame 
 and get it together perfect combination for delays and cancelled flightlations
 sorry that is sad answer fully refundable first fare and no response in weeks no more aa in my future 
 thank you for the info changes need to be made over the phone correct is there any way an aa agent can call me directly 
 are you bot haha always same lies from you 
 especially during death in the family and still no solution hours and counting thanks
 fortunately the window seat was no show able to scoot over and create space 
 so great aa sitting for an hour first technical problems now what 
 this has to be the absolute worst experience ever 
 so have to call back at since the department is closed this has to be the biggest bunch of bull 
 just need to know why it wasn done like it was promised it would yesterday
 too late flight now boarded exit rows taken could not have gotten worse guy next me should ve bought seats miserablemorning
 did that yesterday on the phone with them now
 re staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you 
 statement wasn sent yesterday like jeanine said after even called last night as well again excellent service
 so who do need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so can get the credit for the charges 
 months of straight travel ahead time to find new airline 
 that what is on my ticket and my confirmation email anything else 
 m flying into dca my bag is at iad am already late flight for my meetings at work will call the number when land 
 try this dpdfpp
 face palm cannot believe the last hrs hrs of sleep and no and no and what you can do 
 just wow regina just told me can file or request lost bag statement until finish my travel so until get to dc argg
 shared my experience several times aa ref but aa response is senseless weather was not the cause 
 record number is bpdfpp 
 you should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite condescending platitudes 
 embassy suites woodland park drive herndon virginia us 
 is non existent and will take this as far as needed why hide behind corporate logo provide number tcf useless amateur
 lax ogg lax using hard earned miles and was given lousy service faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag your customer care
 they were no where to be found at midnight last night would think the agent in lax could have relayed that info bag on flt
 you cancelled flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat not acceptable upgrade to emergency row would help nothappy
 is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage bag and not replace and shrug the damage off flights from 
 it isn good enough you need to provide phone number other partners do should be investigated by 
lol great answer our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible we appreciate your patience 
 super spring tides and tide of the century drawing tourists to french and k coasts 
 ps was right 
 yes it is in dulles and need it delivered to the embassy suites in herndon va m still in chicago from the fiasco in lax
 what the point so can wait for another weeks r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
 machines are broken lines are out the door for self service cust support and bag check in 
 would have been had seen this before pm est when was sound asleep 
 merged airlines do not work for ff programs very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care attitudeissues
 you don have those abilities anywhere not at the ticket counter at cust service or online that why we re done here 
 when you strand someone in city without luggage you would think aa would want to earn your business but guess not 
 needs to get their shit together counter people amp massive line people need to catch their flights mqfmxebxt
 know your policy just asking for little kindness due to extenuating circumstances 
 the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing just wow
 oh no she left the counter and went downstairs then she told elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter 
 of course you are because that your companies job you guys failed at it in the first place upgrade me and then we ll talk 
 maybe long trip late flight night amp queues at baggage claims in two terminals no good thought paid for it instead 
 you really need some customer service training for your unhappy ees in the morning in chicago gate at chking her schd
 sat on the runway for more hrs takeoff hrs late flight am pilot plainly stated it was comp mech issue 
 flight prepares for flight at before departing for 
 alright prove it days ago sat on plane at jfk for hrs deplaned for more and when re boarded

 worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
 terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over days total angrycustomer

 aa good job overselling this flight delayed minutes to deplane the overflow passengers bags 
 ve been on the line waiting for minutes again 
 you know nothing about customer service and ll make sure everyone knows it
 understand flight cancelled flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for hrs is not acceptable 
 now have to pay for hotel car ride miss classes which pay for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
 your kept hanging up on me and made me miss second flight
 yeah that not helping having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped 
 did times and no one was helpful m missing work nd school nd the manager rem from mia told me he didn want to talk us
 my flight to was cancelled flightled mess ensued please thank the awesome marcos concierge key gru for sorting it out 
 haven been rebooked called and left my number for callback but haven heard anything and my flight is tomorrow 
 not enough push crews for jfk he delay and counting 
 cannot believe how long flight phi is taking know it us airways but you own it would really like to get home 
 hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges love being here for two extra days 
 same as yesterday cancelled flighted flight aa your customer support is just awful 
 big surprise flight is delayed hopefully not for hours like our flight here thanks again for sleepless night 
 really not even worthy of response this is beginning of social media alert to the world that aa and are useles
 hi aa friends my sis flight aa dfw gt gt mke was cancelled flighted due to weather any way you can help here what are her options 
 is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg 
 have not there no option for even getting call back 
 tomorrows flight cancelled flighted understand three hour wait for call back and now minutes on hold not cool 
 all flights cancelled flighted tomorrow and that means m stranded at the airport for the night wow 
 how hard is it to have catering ready to go 
 why does your iphone app not have any sort of notifications option 
 this is unbelievable and unacceptable flight jfk everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day 
 made my flight but then still had no update emails when landed no info ever sent on that or second flight losing my biz 
 flight dfw still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded still waiting
 still am not on flight ive been here allll day and now we re not boarding because we re waiting for catering 
 my husband and year old son stuck overnight in dc thanks to crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
 if this is how you guys work then will never fly with you guys again 
 versus in customer service who will win for me is convenience to trip to cali lt 
 agents refuse to help too busy amp need to call advantage no one willing to help and apparently being exec plat means zero
 fight got cancelled flighted can help me rebook flight call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold yuck
 you should be contacting her for refund dm me and will provide phone number
 ah if only we could get through we ve tried for over hrs can we call 
 this is ridiculous you all really have terrible customer service and lack of urgency im convinced 
 of course it wasn your intention issue lies in lack of response she did contact you directly she sat on hold for mins
 have been waiting at this airport since am and have to wait until tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help 
 pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
 trying to check in for flight on line not working amp agents too busy to take my call 
 yep they moved me to as they showed me flying standby 
 understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
 my baggage is lost my flight cancelled flightled and get no accommodations not even to another airline at least one free hotel 
 m on into dallas do have any chance of catching to boston do need to run from gate to

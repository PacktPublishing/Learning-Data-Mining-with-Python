negative,"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
negative,"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
neutral,@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
negative,@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United

negative,@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
negative,@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
negative,@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
negative,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
negative,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
negative,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
negative,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
positive,@united I wanna be grand staff
negative,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
negative,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
negative,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
negative,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
positive,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
negative,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
negative,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
negative,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
negative,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
negative,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet"
negative,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
negative,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
negative,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
negative,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
negative,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
neutral,"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
negative,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
negative,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
negative,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
negative,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
negative,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
negative,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
negative,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
negative,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
negative,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
negative,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
negative,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
negative,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
positive,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
negative,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
negative,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
negative,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars

negative,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
negative,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
negative,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
negative,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
negative,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
negative,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
negative,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
negative,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
negative,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
negative,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
negative,@united it will be on a different airline.
negative,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
negative,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"

positive,@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
negative,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"

negative,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
negative,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
negative,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
negative,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
positive,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer

negative,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
negative,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.

negative,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"

negative,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke

negative,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.

negative,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
negative,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
negative,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
negative,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
negative,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
negative,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
positive,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
negative,@united lol too little too Late Flight
negative,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
negative,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability

negative,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
negative,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
negative,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
negative,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.

negative,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
negative,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
negative,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
negative,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!

negative,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
negative,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
negative,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
negative,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.

negative,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
negative,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
negative,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
negative,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
negative,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."

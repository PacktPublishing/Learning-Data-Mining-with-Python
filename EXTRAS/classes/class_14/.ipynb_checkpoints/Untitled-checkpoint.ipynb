    "JSON stands for ‘JavaScript Object Notation’, as it was derived from the JavaScript programming language.\n",

    "It's a predictable, open-standard, language-independent format in which we exchange information with servers. Obviously, this makes using JSON beneficial for everyone involved. That's why the JSON format became widely popular. For instance, as we already mentioned, when we send a request to an API, data is often returned as a JSON. Another example is the payload data of a POST request which is also written in JSON.\n",

    "The JSON format relies on 3 key concepts:\n",

    "*    it should be easy for humans to read, write and understand;\n",

    "The usefulness of JSON lies in the fact that it's versatile and relatively concise. What's more, it's faster than other similar file formats, while it's already widely used for web-related applications, making it easy to find mature programming libraries for it. Moreover, JSON is very intuitive, and many text editors have built-in functionality for viewing such files in an easy-to-read way. Furthermore, it's easy to create and edit JSON files yourself using a text editor, while programmatically, it's a walk in the park. "

However, JSON is less verbose than XML, as it uses fewer words in a simpler format to convey the same information. It is also far easier to translate into code. XML needs specialized, slow parsers that incorporate it into your program. And that is its main disadvantage.\n",
